extravagant silverware emanates an eerie glow onto the remains of a beautifully set dinner the leftover portions of a roasted hog stacks of fried chicken platters of thickly sliced steak and a pan of baked salmon makes up the center surrounding it are various partially or fully eaten side dishes of candied yams mashed potatoes corn on the cob pan fried noodles potato salad and macaroni salad to name a few seated at the table are ten individuals all as different as night is to day standing at the master end is a man in black slacks black muscle shirt and with a black cloth covering from under his nose to the neckline of his shirt his eyes are pure black with no pupils but they do appear to have a reflection of the candle on the table another man walks in wearing a monkstyle robe black bald and seemingly in his s he takes a place next to the man already standing at the master end welcome how was dinner each individual guest provides some sort of a response good would anyone like dessert a few shake their heads either in agreement or disagreement while others voice their personal choice let's get to the damn point says one of the guests as he slams both of his fists on the table silence overtakes the room the host says sure mr explode you're right enough of the small talk everyone knows everyone by now i'm sure a man who is overly handsome and dressed in some royaltystyle get up says no not everyone knows everyone who's the mute we have been here almost six hours and she hasn't spoken a word yeah and what's up with the face mask and completely hidden identity bit body looks good but i want see the face too continued the identical twin of the handsome man also wearing a matching outfit well zarr and razz too bad you can't use your special ability to read each other's thoughts on her instead or you might already know the answers to your questions replied the host humph zarr and razz sigh she ladies and gentlemen is shadow she is on hire from the katsuya corporation she added the host until he was interrupted katsuya corporation interrupted a short stout and rugged looking man with a face full of hair and sporting lumberjack gear another man wearing tan khaki's hawaiian shirt and mirrorlike sunglasses answers yeah rugged it's a camera company why do we need anyone from a capitalist camera corporation asks rugged with rage in his voice you idiot you need to get out more it's a front for the japanese mafia snapped the man in the sunglasses slamming the palms of his hands on the table the host takes back control of the situation enough this gets everyones attention focused back on him back to the issue at hand the reason you have been gathered here each of you has been asked to join this venture because each of you are world renowned treasure and relic hunters each with their own unique talents or abilities which will help ensure the success of this mission he surveys the room each of you will be paid one million dollars half will be paid tonight and the other half will be paid upon completion of the mission you will also be able to keep all the spoils of the trip that you may happen to pick up all i ask in return is one item that item is the stone of sunfire a few members seem to have heard of it but most seem to have no clue as to what it is it seems that some of you have never heard of it well i'm not surprised its rumored to have only been seen by a handful of people and the place it was last seen is considered a myth only a few believe it exists atlantis since proving atlantis exists which has been next to impossible to prove the stone of sunfire is sort of a myth of myths in a jokeful manner the man in the sunglasses says so you want us to find atlantis good luck no mr bebida blood fortunately an even less known myth told among several tribes in south america tells a tale that during the brief time of turmoil rumored to occurred before atlantis sunk a very skillful thief sent by king foymama stole this item and returned it to him says the host tripwire a skilled adventurer and expert on ancient traps and devices asks king foymama the king of greed what's so special about this king asks gladiator a very muscular all american male wearing blue jeans and a usa pride tshirt glad you asked continues the host foymama let his wife the queen run the kingdom while he sent spies and thieves to steal valuable treasures and artifacts from other kingdoms he also led several expeditions himself foymama's main interest was in mystical objects items rumored to have some kind of magical forces within he used some of these itemss power to grow richer and more powerful then news came from one of his spies that several powerful armies were joining together to steal back their treasures and plunder much more being driven by greed and not wanting to lose his priceless artifacts which was the largest collection the world had ever seen king foymama used the horn of calling to summon the demon poss chandela and begged to be able to keep his treasures forever inside the tomb he built specifically to spend his afterlife with his immense treasure the next day when the attacking army arrived there was no sign of the tomb it had vanished then how the hell are we supposed to find it asks explode in his typical angry way the same tribe i heard the tale from is the cristah tribe who are the actual descendants of the foymama tribe they carry with them the ranakan the stone of awareness which can be used to reveal the tomb that's where you natural hack come in your tracking skills with your laptop are legendary i will supply you with all the data on the tribe including their last location natural hack nods in agreement and adds just call me hack the host asks rugged i do believe you are familiar with the kung tribal language and their use of clicking sounds to communicate correct you are correct i know i am they use a very similar style it should be no problem to figure out i did zarr asks so how much is this sunshine or firestone thing worth anyways razz adds i was thinking the same thing zarr replies i know that's why i asked they both smile at each other it is priceless but so are many of the treasures in foymamas tomb to guarantee that someone does bring it back to me or that the mission was a failure because of misinformation i've planted a mole one of you has been a business associate of mine for quite some time and is being paid million dollars to be my eyes and ears so if one of you does find the item and tries to run i will kill you which is of course after ive killed several family members i found you once and i will find you again during this whole spiel the host made eye contact with all at the table and his facial expression and tone of speech did n't change one bit for the second time in minutes silence controls the room everyone seems to be looking at each other with accusing eyes the only ones not looking around are gladiator who had been refilling his plate at a regular pace during the whole briefing and xiona chang who has been silent since dinner was placed on the table gladiator notices several eyes on him noticeably uncomfortable he says with a mouthful of steak what i'm not a mole i've never seen this man before in my life then all eyes turn toward xiona who in her red traditional chinese evening dress was already stunning to the eyes now she finds eyes looking at her quite differently she looks up at everyone yet says nothing the host interrupts this awkward moment enough worrying about that each one of you needs your rest sleep well i must be leaving now if you need anything my servants will be glad to assist you the host walks off followed by his apparent bodyguard down the hallway and out of earshot the host stops and says to his companion kain you're probably wondering why don't i go instead of sending them after all i'm more qualified and skilled than all of them put together kain says nothing with the flames still visibly burning in his eyes simply i have other plans instead of being stuck in there for years if the mission fails and who knows it might be even longer than that before anyone enters the tomb again kain still stands silently what's that you say kain the mole who is it i planted no mole i planted something much better distrust if the stone is there and i believe it is then if even only two survive it's guaranteed to be returned because of the fear of the mole if more than two survive i will be truly surprised and as you know i have n't been surprised in years tomorrow will be very entertaining for you chapter two mr blood walks into the same conference room as the night before to find that he's the last one to come to the breakfast table standing at the master end is kain but noticeably missing is the host so what 'd i miss asks bebida nothing much gladiator has already devoured seven pancakes six sausages about ten eggs um did i miss anything asks razz yeah four glasses of oj and five glasses of milk adds zarr do n't forget the four biscuits laughs gladiator with his mouth full so nothing much then asks bebida nope not really but we now know who the mole is says tripwire hack who has been dealing with these acquisitions all morning frustrated yells i'm not the damn mole sure youre not then why the fuck did the host put you in charge charges explode i'm not in charge he came in last night to give me the data on the tribe and left me instructions to share with everyone since he could n't be here today so what was he wearing asks rugged fuck you hack yells across the table laughter echoes around the room lifting some of the tension anyways let's hear those instructions says bebida good we were waiting for you to come down i've tracked down where the tribe is located using my connection to a global positioning satellite do n't ask how anyways we are to leave at hours by helicopter which will drop us off miles away from the tribe 's present location miles why so far away asks bebida because this tribe has a leadership structure that is quite unique and no central home all in this tribe are equal with the exception of the one responsible for the stone he serves as chief then after roughly one week a different person receives the stone and leader role and with no central home there 's no telling who has it all any given time explained hack so questions bebida xiona answers these tribe members do n't sleep in close quarters with only about twenty members of this tribe they have been found sleeping separately almost one mile away from the nearest member everyone looks at xiona some shocked that she knew that others surprised she talked bringing the attention of everyone back to himself bebida asks so we are performing a dragnet to make sure none escape exactly cause if the one with the stone escapes it might take days or even weeks to find him and now we have on our side the element of surprise answers hack rugged asks rudely so where 's the host at hack i do n't know why do n't you ask kain retaliates hack the massive monstrosity does n't move looking at kain rugged replied um i 'll pass explode stands up swiftly want me to ask him zarr still seated reaches out toward explode i would think twice about that big fellow something seems very odd about that one there razz extends his arm also and adds yes i agree have n't you noticed the fire in his eyes is still there from last night yet there is no flame that it could be reflecting zarr says i was just thinking the same thing razz replies i know you were they both look at each other and smile explode now notices the flame but still says so i'm not scared of no punks with trippy contacts xiona stands up it 's not about being scared it 's about being smart something i can tell most at this table lack as she gets up from the table and starts to exit the room explode yells shut up mole hack asks calmly can we all get back on track please the helicopter will be ready for departure soon the remaining guests look at explode explode is wondering why everyone is looking at him what no one says anything finally explode sits back down while kain remains the same do n't worry about xiona 's part i 'll brief her on the copter okay here 's the plan hack continues finally every member seems focused including gladiator who has finally stopped eating chapter three now yells hack from the cover of some bushes a split second later an explosive device lands in the center of what resembles a central activity area of the tribe a minor explosion is followed by plenty of smoke and villagers trying to flee bingo yells tripwire as four tribe people are slung up into the air and trapped in a net two other villagers are doublearm clotheslined and dropped by gladiator as they try to run into the bushes oh yeah man i really miss wrestling the smoke is clearing hack asks is that every one of them razz as he holds a villager answers yeah i believe so adds zarr who also is holding one shadow walks out of the bushes into the clearing with a villager already bound yeah that 's all of them counting the six we caught on the outskirts says hack as xiona comes out of the brush with those six shackled together so how we are supposed to know which one has the stone asks rugged i do n't know are n't you the language specialist replies hack um oh yeah rugged turns toward the closest villager and asks in the tribe 's native tongue which he has been learning from the previous six hostages the villager replies back with similar clicking sounds what 'd he say asks hack just like the other villagers he says he does n't know what i 'm talking about explode pulls out his gun from his leg strap aims and shoots i bet he understands this the villager that shadow was holding drops to the ground dead with a hole in his chest xiona yells what the hell are you doing explode yells shut the fuck up bitch he turns his gun toward her but before he could make the full swinging motion a ninja star knocks the gun out of his hand and another star sticks into the leg holster where his gun was only inches away from his family jewels if you ever aim a weapon at me or speak to me in that tone again your gun wo n't be the only thing falling to the ground threatened xiona now holding in front of her a sword gripped with both hands explode is pissed but realizes he 's in no position to argue he removes the star from his leg and throws it to the ground some of the villagers are now crying and struggling to no avail to be close to their fallen fellow tribe member maybe now we 'll get some damn answers says explode yeah you're probably right said bebida as he dipped his fingers in the fresh wound of the dead villager he sucks the blood off his fingers while standing in the face of another villager bebida smiles exposing some of his fanged teeth just maybe you're right gladiator is standing nearby with the two he captured who are now tied to a tree awe you're fucking sick man he then turns and vomits in nearby bushes hmmm bebida smiles as he looks at the dead body a fresh new taste one of the villagers a male starts yelling something in his native tongue rugged walks over to him and starts conversing well asks hack well it looks like explode 's tactics worked this boy has the stone replies rugged explode grins see i fucking told you hack approaches the villager who appears to be in his late teens early twenties ask him where the tomb is located rugged and the villager exchange words he said he will show you if you spare his people brave for his age admirable okay tell him no problem consider it done answers hack to the dismay of explode who mumbles something and walks off into the bush hack continues but assure him that if this is a trick that we will return and slaughter every last one of them while he is forced to watch rugged relays the message the villager replies rugged confirms to hack understood good hack orders everyone to release the villagers and head back to camp everyone does as told chapter four back at camp all the members of the expedition are present including their new captive gladiator is over in a clearing doing pushups explode is sitting on a rock cleaning his gun rugged is catching a nap in the shade of a tree
