small quiet town kind everyone knows name
place parents wouldnt even care stayed late biking friends
everyone felt safe comfy
dont know half

know starlings place want dark
reason no one knows jason emily seth kept way
walked along empty road alone occasionally waving passing kids bikes
backpack slung shoulder filled writing books sketchpads
kept eyes shadowed road watching every step
usually aware surroundings today tired didnt care rammed tree
kicked rock grass
sun starting set painting sky brilliant oranges reds
slipped sky allowing first stars peek behind bright curtain
remaining light cast shadows everything creating illusion double everything
world prepared go hours unreal silence made seem magical really
phone buzzed awoke trance
thumbed keypad opened message seth sent
read whatcha
flipped open pad wrote walking home
shoved back pocket continued walking
sun almost gone shadows starting appear behind everything
looked shadow danced behind
phone buzzed seth sent reply

glanced nearby woods
ears heard nothing didnt see movement hands shook slightly typed nothing fine
didnt open reply knew say
already knew strangely quiet
maybe stay home sleep one night
maybe finish painting tonight watch mom origami
turned corner house came view
started climb hill froze
left eye saw outline creature
heading woods direction house
swore breath took woods
feet crunched fallen branches leaves
see creature ahead
didnt much time
placed bag ground crossed legs

lucky easy take
closed eyes began mental countdown
wind picked around wind current appeared nowhere
body started feel hot like hugged sun
hated part
power surged freed human self
shivers ran spine
felt cold like dipped ice water
breeze picked even harder
hollow probably see body opened eyes
never get courage
wind died
body felt normal except different
opened eyes looked still
human body slightly glowed sat meditation tree

see monster clearly stepped world
hunched occasionally touching ground one curled front paws
dark saliva dripped mouth
beady black eyes made no less scary

shiver ran spine
thrashers probably one feral nasty monsters ive ever encountered
sometimes travel alone hunt packs
theyre awful packs extremely hard take without knowledge presence
placed arrow bow aimed head
couldnt let creature reach house

instead lowered bow slowly crept see hideous claws hands hatred eyes
thrashers hate everything sometimes wonder tolerate

bible staying
purple bolivia pastor martir mentioned quechua bible conference ways bolivian countryside certainly kidding
calculations eight hours gone since left vibrant garden city cochabamba climbing higher higher clouds
wara cadogan slit eyes open squinted around darkened interior jeep
windowpanes frosted sun hid behind jagged peaks andes
elbow jabbed side wara heard friend nazaret martir yawn squeaky muffled sound caused father pastor martir glance girls rearview mirror
second told much chipper cooped jeep day
know freezing soon get warmed
long hike
wara stuffed numb hands sleeves alpaca sweater bit lip
let talked
loved martirs large family basically adopted wara six years missionary bolivia
linguistics major wara usually jumped chance travel countryside practice speaking quechua
pastor martir said needed translate spanish quechua conference potosi wara enthusiastically answered
bad idea
bad idea
bible conference wara
thinking
pastor martir steered jeep cavernous rut wara felt jaw snap impact
turquoise knit cap wore slid one eye
pushed hat back position low moan came back seat
stressed wara grinned
best guy friend noah waking perch back luggage

heard mutter breath
place looks like twilight zone
one long arm brushed wara ear reached clear frost window
single light outside murky sky tossed thick shadows
skeletal remains tree rose gravel path beckoning jeep forward
noah right looked downright freaky
pushing back nervousness whole bible conference thing wara turned towards back seat
despite rough ride noah looking content emerald green eyes glinting moonlight
sandy shoulder length hair littered straw poor guy really hunch fit frame tight space top luggage
first glance noah hearst might give aura surfer dude really full muscle
fat
noah big guy
plus really lot surfers ohio noah
nice nap back potatoes
asked
noah tried stretch grimaced gave

glanced around car took pastor martir two skinny quechua speaking bible school students front wara nazaret middle seat
guess one carrying stuff conference lunch
seriously good
nazaret dad must thrilled got translate though
word street speak quechua like native
true
despite cold wara felt armpits prick
used good
first year wara lived bolivia worked teaching bible lessons ladies quechua helped ton children bible clubs around city
everything happened
left country four months try get things together came back teaching literacy classes quechua women
volunteering home children aids martir family ran
teach bible anymore make hypocrite
noah good friend never asked
never get lucky noah going
sounding bolivian looking
imagine anyone ever mixing bolivian
no
wara raised eyebrow stifled smile
seriously worried anybody thought bolivian
addition tall blond skin crisped red strong cochabamba sun noah studied spanish spain
whenever guy spoke spanish came lisp bolivians sounded really silly
noah good reason jealous wara
besides teaching quechua time baby wara quechua grandmother peru passed along color
wara skin light tan bronzed sun
behind trendy maroon glasses eyes honey brown
brown hair sporting uneven cut burgundy highlights let fit right bolivian friends
think getting cold nazaret announced smally wara side
wara turned back took friend pale heart shaped face framed dyed blond ringlets
sheathed puffy pink coat mounds pink scarves snow white knit hat pale pink sparkles
jeep hit another hard rut nazaret sneezed cute shrill little sound muffled tiny pink alpaca mittens
hov still help wif kids sniffled bleary hazel eyes turned noah patted white knit cap encouraging words
jerked attention jeep braked halt sudden spray gravel
group piled car discovered air outside car even colder inside
even though look ridiculous wara almost wished wearing snow pants like little growing montana
frayed jeans hippie tunic alpaca sweater anything keep warm
frozen fingers brushed lazily cheeks hulking mountains around
distance something howled
nazaret covered nose one mitten muffle another sharp sneeze echoed mountains night
scuse
noah cheerfully pushed past wara carting gigantic burlap sack potatoes
coming nazaret father followed hauling second bag something edible
wara huddled next nazaret minute watching guys hefted food sleeping bags onto haggle scrawny burros
quechua guys black jackets slacks materialized adobe hut helping arrange everything donkeys light shimmering bonfire
pastor martir came every year preach rural bible conference potosi said best climb mountain night cooler
right wara really hoped knew talking
still seven hour hike ahead forested granite
stifled heavy yawn fixed gaze diamond stars
morning woke scruffy feathers beak
chicken scratched pebbles right outside crumbling adobe wall community school house others crashed hours hike
local christians gone trouble fixing wooden pallets woolen blankets school guests private place stay
wara knew gone lot trouble hated admit honestly worth going sleep
well organized army fleas taken residence wool blankets long noah nazaret scratched grumbled hours pastor martir coated beds raid
maybe daylight streaming holes schoolhouse wall darn hard move
overdose raid
wara kicked sleeping bag grabbed glasses dirt floor pulled sitting
pastor martir already gone probably outside morning prayer vigil quechua christians
nazaret curled plank bed still snoring
noah long legs stuck end unzipped sleeping bag leaving filthy socked feet sprawled dirt near giant maroon nike tennis shoes
moved stand powdery remains dried fleas shifted navy fleece sleeping bag
eeww
wara grin sight dried bugs
really loved kind trips
dusted bare feet edge jeans stuffed sockless feet doc marten boots hoping find someplace outside use bathroom everyone else got
waist high cluster boulders overlooking valley turned best option privacy
brushed teeth water dented bottle pura vida spit deserted valley
trailing wisps clouds slithered around boulders
structures visible schoolhouse slept two sturdy adobe houses little way rounded path
quechua lady huge smile waiting school breakfast sweet purple corn drink boiled eggs
wore knee length circle skirt called pollera one soft sage green
despite morning chill mahogany legs bare wore scuffed black plastic ballet flats
warm cardigan lacy white blouse quechua ladies always wore
lady bringing breakfast introduced doa petronia patted wara forearm greeting telling happy god brought wara conference
wara smiled back wanly even though lot fun speaking quechua mountains
still feel good idea part bible conference acting like sweet good pastor martir noah bible school students
felt like fake
still queasy mumbled something appropriate tried get purple api egg
assigned help noah charge kids parents attended bible classes
wara already seen action many times five years friends teaching bible stories kids martirs aids center hanging little homeless kid downtown cochabamba
within minutes noah group kids sitting grassy knoll captivated bible songs actions
made wara come stand next translate story quechua one jesus calming stormy sea
grew church rattle story heart english spanish quechua
no way keep group kids glued every word way noah
ignored sick feeling stomach stood next noah feeling little insignificant five foot five next six foot three
tell noah story kids quechua
failings ruin moment kids
noah deserved listened
story see kids eyes imagined every peal thunder felt shuddering splintered wooden boat open sea
noah asked kids come stand side one one tell afraid
enough eat hail destroys crops mumbled one almond eyed little boy jade chullu cap
afraid terrible goat lives hill
several muffled giggles scattered across group
thunder storms
one short boy tattered soccer jersey trudged front turn recited gravely scared brothers become one missing like brother antonio
wara scrunched face
never heard anyone refer someone died missing quechua maybe regional idiom
going ask around later figure really phrase used
nerd
blinked away thoughts quechua grammar brought attention back noah beaming children waiting translate
know little told kids dog lived houses away mine really really big teeth
suddenly strangely noah slung arm wara shoulders leaving two facing children together
want know kids jesus scared anything
stronger anything world
mesmerized noah words kids wara felt leaning side
lesson
thanks translating noah told dropped arm smiled
wara felt heart weird pitter patter stared jogged chase kids game tag
attraction feeling
chided warily
noah friend
never think noah anything friend

wara blinked squinted noah grabbing giggling little kid around shoulders swinging air
crazy let think noah anything friend
much goofy anything else
wara always studying sometimes really grouchy
noah always happy go lucky watched way many cartoons
exactly prince charming
plus really know
wara shook back reality headed back towards house thinking probably help ladies fix lunch
cloud covered valley writhed mist licking emerald grass feet
hauntingly beautiful
rocky dirt outside main house found circle quechua women squatting wide velvet pollera skirts around plastic tub potatoes
ladies skillfully attacked miniscule purple yellow veined potatoes paring knives leaving spuds without peel seconds
wara hunkered next smiling lady breakfast morning doa petronia
wara tried hard learn peel potatoes like respectable quechua woman usually ended desecrating potato scraping half scrap pile
fiddled around little knife bumpy yellow potato decided put grammar question
wondering something one kids said
say family member missing mean person died
doa petronia long blade faltered mid peel reached one work roughed hand flip braid behind back
everyone fell silent
must heard son edgar talking finally nodded
six worried older brother
maybe juan marco talking older brother interjected portly woman royal purple pollera
thick layer fat rolled waist skirt blanketed silky white undershirt ladies wore short lace blouses
jerked chin towards doa petronia
older sons teenagers
three months ago boys went away never heard
went away
wara frowned
call missing
doa petronia looked wara directly eye
boys went llallagua sell potatoes completely different days
never heard
know gone
call boys missing
boys
two women eyed soberly
mountains many different communities
missing
wara know say
women sons boys communities gone
pain women black eyes evident wara felt horrible
many people bible conference son brother disappeared
really glad nazaret still teaching somewhere
hope already heard
martirs busy household six kids upon time seven
wara knew nazaret older brother run away teenager knew serious skinny oldest martir faded photograph frame nazaret dresser
talking missing kids always enough start nazaret weeping
wara really hoped friend hear
make think brother missing boy probably never going come home
identify little kid picture sometimes thought much things wara wanted run away start
except past always follows
noah running hill panting hundred screaming quechua kids close heels
even wanted noah never deserve
things even time erase

know personally hated salazar much
another scumbag offed
except stalin absolutely know thing decision alejo trying make
roads outside peshawar cut dry dusty mountain faces incredibly sheer drop offs framed narrow edges
eventually hummer left peaks jolted across stony field rutted tracks barely visible weak light dawn
everywhere mud brick houses sprung rocky dust shattered missiles empty shells family life must filled
small children sometimes lined road staring huge kohl lined eyes impressive hummer roared past clouding ragged bodies billows thick dust
sometime around noon armored hummer arrived run village consisting cluster houses around stone well
mangy skeletal donkeys wandered tethered fraying ropes
scrawny chickens free range dusty central courtyard
baby cried franticly inside one single room homes
piece burlap hung small window stirred dark form peered baby immediately hushed
somewhere near distance dull echo missile launcher pounded surrounding mountains
alejo started realized near current battle zone
cool hiss metallic doors hummer unlocked opened
mateen took long drink two liter bottle luke warm coca cola
pashtun guards leapt car weapons gripped tightly rough hands
settle settle khan barked pashto appearing amused
nothing afraid right village

alejo leather sandals sucked mud followed ishmael
thin plume smoke snaked chimney building slate gray sky
alejo halted impatiently outside splintered wooden door khan called building pashto curt answer came back khan motioned happily alejo open door
features impassive alejo pushed way cautiously darkened building found less expected room tightly packed mud caked exhausted mujahedeen taking early morning snooze fire heading fight enemy combatants
wore grimy shalwar kameezs traditional pashtun hats ring around bottom bulging like wool muffin top
men looked thin fed much young
many body parts wrapped dirt encrusted ratty bandages mottled dried blood
around one hundred pairs brown battle weary eyes stared back alejo vision adjusted dim lighting
felt khan push past forcing inside room
well come see surprise
alejo confused let show cocking eyebrow ishmael
interested radical fighters petty battles slight differences religion generational blood feuds

asalaam alaikum
ishmael greeted men enthusiastically obviously knowing made effort sit straighter respect returned pashto greeting

grimy aquamarine walls dominated small eating place shocking color cheap plastic mats spread across floor
several groups men already eating lunch one leg folded support right arm bent cross legged woven mat
right hand pashtun men scooped cooked spinach torn pieces oven roasted naan bread
along one wall lay scattered pile black plastic sandals varying states muddiness
several men blackened bare feet twitched inches away food
bon apetit
digging gabriel slipped cell phone one pocket check time
yep
time prayers
around twenty men room began unroll tattered prayer mats special corner restaurant working one man spread rows middle uneven concrete floor facing mecca
town mosque must near judging volume haunting call prayer suddenly cut air loudspeaker
customers already lunch simply pray together
small spigot water outside door concrete courtyard provided place men perform wudu ritual washing prayers
gabriel waited turn trickle water began focus mind allah washed parts required prophet
alejo took gabriel place faucet began washing quiet morose
gabriel bare wet feet made sucking sound padded back inside across muddy concrete large moist footprints mingling others create mosaic darkened patches restaurant floor
frigid rivulets water formed crystal drops like sweat gabriel face wet spiky hair chin
kneeling next alejo gabriel prostrated mat began pray one alone reward eternal life

khan sent tell pick eight little good bye dinner mateen announced
smile twitched mateen bushy black beard bowed deferentially glided back towards silver bmw idling outside door

people accused bolivians always tardy everything really no idea
pakistanis beat
seeing beard reminded gabriel pathetic attempt grow beard order good muslim
inches reddish peachy fuzz dusting chin least showed made effort pious

door apartment pounded shut sighed left alone
shiny distorted image glimmered back mirror golden wardrobe opposite wall gabriel scowled measly beard pack

maybe settle watch sermon one mullahs
trusty hiker backpack propped next bed gabriel opened huge gold wardrobe pulled stack folded shalwar kameezs sweaters jeans
babies
first carefully lifted favorite quran inside black leather quran case position respect highest table room gently placed inside backpack

gabriel fondly clicked case open revealing smooth honey wood violin
guy since parents given sixteenth birthday violin always came gabriel anywhere went important
carefully placed small case inside backpack

violin wherever go home
left money
understood reasons sometimes really wished boss pay cash
debit cards existed reason
gabriel decided deposit cash bank one many banks close apartment account
pulled fraying gray sweater long shalwar kameez headed bank
thirty minutes later disposed cash gabriel strolled lazily one peshawar main thoroughfares thick haze ochre smog pollution
bordering sidewalk heavy buses painted like kaleidoscopes rumbled next wooden donkey carts
chorus thousand horns blared
two female shapes heavily shrouded black veils fell ground glided front gabriel began weave way across street
though modestly covered girls huge dark eyes exposed gabriel tell must young maybe age
realized thinking face began slow burn
ashamed even noticing
allah help
offered great mission unworthy
got make pure clean
please
still praying ducked past street vendor sizzling vat curry winding alleyway already shadowy approaching night
crunching sensation angst belly came moment gabriel eyes told erred let mind wander away surroundings
barely registered shadowy shapes three men suddenly surged behind peripheral vision came flash adrenaline
force bodies propelled gabriel face first coarse concrete wall
feeling true panic gabriel swore spanish
two men gripped arms tightly behind back third tore gabriel cap threw ground grabbed hair turn face toward either side

gabriel gasped pashto
maybe mistaken someone else
light skin look lot like afghani
shut
look die
yelled one men voice sounded like traffic accident
yanked gabriel head back hair exposing neck scraping nose chin painfully across pock marked wall
felt prick wicked knife pressed throat
looking
gabriel stammered hating able control tremor
alejo fight guys
something hot tangy oozed gabriel bloodied lip onto tongue
taste blood made want gag
give money got bank
demand came one men shadowy darkness back alley way
cut throat dirty afghan
gabriel swallowed hard took steadying breath

thank god nothing wallet identify westerner usual
afghan identity card thanks khans
snarl several pashto curses told gabriel indeed thieves pleased pittance wallet rumpled slip told twenty thousand euros deposited victim left bank began follow
man holding blade gabriel throat swore violently ear
hold
rough hands dug upper arms
someone else pulled hair forcing gabriel face towards sky
knife slashed throat like sting thousand wasps eyes rolled back head
everything hazed midnight world black gabriel shara even crumpled thieves feet next graffiti covered wall
terribly strange aware world passing around yet feel immobile stone limbs heavy petrified wood
drifting awareness gabriel finally reached point realizing move lips try speak tried say help
dirty room filled ivs cots chess board little table pieces paused mid game
ivs mean doctors hospital
chess game
dead
gabriel felt heart beat slow cold
possibly kind freaky afterlife filled rusting metal cots eternal games chess
dead
gabriel attempted roll one side morbid curiosity winning sluggishness
something stabbed neck chest movement yelled suddenly remembering alley thieves knife slitting throat
saw alejo materializing strange room followed short little doctor dirty lab coat
take easy gabo alejo said hoarsely

clay dishes clinked kitchen aroma lemon bubbles joined coffee floating around empty coffee shop
footsteps scuffed pavement outside open caf entrance tiago slouched black backpack covered skull patches wearing baggy black jeans chains usual
noah wara threw wave grinned back revealing silver stud tongue wara remember seeing
noah ways go beat tiago piercing count thought still smiling
noah stretched legs table back typing furiously little tablet
squinting thing extreme concentration like successful young stock broker armani suit instead missionary cut khaki shorts really needed haircut

wara cracked eyes open direction tent door saw thin pale face little goatee leaning inside calling paulo
nylon fabric rustled paulo staggered floor shivered pulled second black sweater head
voy whispered light skinned man disappeared leaving tent flap hanging open
coming
paulo turned morbidly serious gaze wara tensed best appear fast asleep
slit eyes open heard padding towards door saw leaving khaki cargo pants bare feet
minute slipped sleeping bag crawled door tent star studded sky crescent moon gave light
almost early morning
guys middle night
time prayers man came get paulo said
wara frowned bit lip
around six men gathered clearing close enough pick said
six men suddenly appeared darkened forest dripping water hair sleeves
six including paulo black sweater walked together trees disappeared
wara settled cross legged watching strange scene bleary eyes
paulo group came back also glistening drops water moonlight men lined facing direction silent without excited chatter
everyone bowed heads wara heard soft rumble chanting together allaahu akbar allaahu akbar ashhadu allah ilaaha illa lah ashhadu allah ilaaha illa lah ash hadu anna muhamadar rasuulullah ash hadu anna muhamadar rasuulullah wara pulse surged knowing listening
linguistics geek definitely recognize arabic
god great
bear witness none worthy worship except god
bear witness muhammad messenger god
saying salaat wara thought absolutely stunned
guys muslims
men still standing hooked hands behind ears turning palms forward repeated allah akbar flat monotone
crossing one hand top front bellies prayed arabic though wara caught little
main gist seemed glory praise allah end heard something satan
recognized opening lines first surah chapter quran
men outside bowed unison backs straight gaze lowered
wara shivered hearing allah akbar
realizing praying men wore long knives hanging belts leather sheathes
attention span suddenly fizzled weakly crawled back sleeping bag quite sure new revelation meant
held captive group muslims
put bomb bus
first time wondered
white star light outside tent wara made shadowy bulk mountain peaks
men must carried unconscious road accident
carried far
one peaks coroico
perfect hiding spot terrorists apparently
ever guess islamic terrorists lurking around coroico adventure tourism capital
coroico stunning scenery picturesque small town charm thick plantings coffee beans oranges
feeling rather sick wara uncapped bottle luke warm water paulo given last night drained rest
really needed use bathroom ask
yet
right really needed distraction something keep thinking muslim terrorists outside tent noah possibly dead
wara dropped empty plastic bottle onto sleeping bag let eyes wander around tent
olive green tent big enough paulo stand center barely
six people possibly sleep thing side side right tent held one sleeping bag rust colored hiking backpack lantern leather sandals

alejo loosed heavy sigh waited outside hostel room door fighting urge find cigarettes serious smoking
quit years ago finding wheezing trying outrun danger bullets pretty inconvenient
suddenly life

ever see faces behind muzzle gun
alejo blinked startled wooden door jerked open found facing nazaret
opened scolded softly
ask first

nazaret round face waned exhausted

alejo forced gaze wide eyed little martirs mother wara sitting wearily together one beds glad see pills bedside table stuff ordered must arrived pharmacy
wara noly obviously deep discussion alejo interrupted heart sunk three notches lower easily imagining little chat
part alejo smacked face nearly slit throat
handcuffed kissed

keys jingled lock alejo tensed relaxed pablo martir entered room
time leave room quickly
wara side thin wall definitely within ear shot case danger
basically ignoring wayward oldest son pastor martir walked among younger children forcing smile patting head
noly pulled little naveli onto lap kissed

alejo surprised wara rolled bed without arguing prepared follow
zombie like expression eyes along lack protest actually worried
wara looked ready collapse
equally worrying fact no one family protested orders least words
suppose argue man confessed killer even son
wara stumbled next towards door
alejo left family locked room disgusted long long time
transparent door slid open wara alejo mute whine
alejo flipped light switch wara pushed past room identical martirs except held two single beds
past point absolute exhaustion wara stumbled one beds kicked white flip flops
wool blanket covered worn striped sheets ripped back covers fell inside
forced breathing even willing sleep sleep
lying hostel room man tried kill noah
sleep bring blessed unconsciousness craved
sleep come
frayed mind whirled around single thought faster faster polishing weighty obsession
finally flipped lumpy bed face alejo still visible dim light small bedside lamp
hunched edge bed wearing gray shirt cargo pants head hands
reason thought crossed wara mind clothes nazaret brother literally left old life clothes back
frowning wara realized probably never go back get stuff wherever lived big trouble
saved wara life

wondered loud
alejo twisted face hazel eyes rimmed red

police never touch alejo continued bribes high friendships
man protected every angle imagine
many children lives ruined sat good man nothing
alejo raised hands make sarcastic quotation marks air around word good lips twisting cynically
paused asked distractedly parents ever tell ruben mamani

alejo caught wara blank look heaved sigh
probably forgot
anyway
franco salazar worked national government mayor quillacollo
medium sized town outskirts cochabamba

long pause composed voice one month later ruben ended ditch dead
alejo shrugged said suddenly no importance

barely able make face peering tinted windows sleek double decker bus depart lima peru
alejo convinced family follow plan call friend church bring clothes market food trip

silky gray rain clouds swirled across evening sky threatening downpour entire martir family boarded bus take away bolivia
nazaret sobbed hugged wara hesitated threw brother weeping chest
alejo back towards wara seen put arms around nazaret pulled away
wara stepped taxi slammed door facing unlit stars hostel
alejo tried kill alone together wara never felt strange
faded pinstriped sheets lumpy pillows still waiting
wara felt even depressed entered hostel room realizing alejo company

without turning around answered carefully think

taxi sped along highway towards sacaba route taken say good bye martirs
even halfway sacaba alejo directed taxi driver veer highway towards gravel covered incline

punched gas letting shiny newer taxi climb towards wherever final destination
spanish pop music filled clean gray interior taxi young driver wearing peach polo shirt tapped muscular forearm steering wheel keep rhythm

alejo usually sleep like baby even rock pillow finally drifted fitful sleep soft red couch
jerked upright foreign sound filling room
cell phone
slapping around darkness got hold metal chain pink floral lamp next couch yanked flooding motel room sickly sweet light
wara already flown across room towards bag throwing clothes looking phone kept drilling tinny tune night

alejo sank back couch hoping call sister need midnight conversation
odds however really good chance call middle night bring good news

alejo exhaled entire body crumpled sank back sheets seemingly buried mass fluffy pillows thick satin bedspread

silence choked thank

alejo head buzzed throat tightened turned stare cows tall white grass whizzing outside van
gabriel silent jerked steering wheel hard right veering delivery truck gravel road onto narrower dirt path thick canopy lacy trees
alejo knew pairumani country estate belonged simon patio
patio one wealthiest men world world war making fortune tin
house gardens lands retreat mansion cochabamba
farther along path low waterfall gurgled along edge road running mossy boulders
tree canopy suddenly dropped away opening breathtaking sight spacious field sapphire blue sky white fluffy stalks wild grain waving gentle breeze
towering crops two stately rows ponderous palm trees lined neat dirt road backdrop mountain peaks right ornate metal gate entrance pairumani estate
alejo raised eyebrow friend turned truck towards gate frowning unhappily
alejo visited place fields dotted various volunteer students working experimental agricultural projects sponsored patio charitable foundation

mom dad hearts set little house japan stalin known immediately upon arriving get settled japan never
creepy creepy words described temples dull golden statues smiling pacifically passed
mlange slippery sea creatures tacked wooden planks wicked looking nails eerie enough sort taxidermy water creatures display
fact part market meant grocery shopping given heebie jeebies
money pilfered bank account stalin bought parents three bedroom house cozy neighborhood full foreigners shiny silver lexus hired two servants clean cook fill house furniture
gotten back plane pleasant destination planning sending parents tickets come visit
old yet
spain seemed like perfect pick settle hide
warm spoke spanish rumors bathing topless
first city cordoba stalin rented nice flat seemed cosmopolitan smacked europe
excitement soon died away found lumbering gray sidewalks day day no job no steady girlfriend no friends speak
conversation alejo day coffee shop jesus kept ringing stalin ears ever since realized alejo whole jesus thing intellectual debate religion right
exact moment stalin realized alejo flinch gun head said change mind jesus god
heavy day
today stalin heart felt heavy well left massive cathedral mass bought strawberry ice cream cone vendor sidewalk
turned one ancient narrow side streets meander way general direction home
really no hurry spain no one went bed midnight moment seven
stalin took large lick sickly sweet ice cream tried clean sticky drop pink lips paper thin napkin wrapped around cone
sudden stopped eyes falling upon little sign picture white dove said libreria paz
smaller letters said libreria evangelica
christian bookstore
non catholic one
something store drew stalin towards rugged stone steps like piece lint funnel vacuum cleaner hesitated
imagined walking store browse books finding swarmed pack hunchbacked crones black dresses head coverings drag gold crowned image virgin force recite rosary born
glass door squeaked quietly little girl wearing hot pink short set skipped steps followed middle aged guy polo shirt father
go people younger eighty come store
maybe something
realizing holding breath stalin drew gust air nearly shrieked feeling cold drip melting ice cream soak fingers
hurriedly licked way around cold cone finger one one glancing around guiltily see anyone watching
finally stalin pulled together clumped stairs bookstore part praying god books worth reading explain let put jesus back mind
bell door jangled softly stalin entered relieved man behind counter waved politely turned away let customer browse shop peace
small bookstore white wooden shelves filled different titles lining walls small section music shirts
ignoring everything books stalin began one end noticing right away volumes seemed rather thin
remembering keep licking ice cream flood bookstore red carpet stalin cocked head sideways better scan titles getting disgruntled went along
one section found books titles new forty days
god control diet exercising jesus
puzzled moved next rows books saw several covers featuring blown photos people white smiles flashy clothes
god wants rich
proclaimed one book image slick hispanic man expensive purple suit
stalin brows drew together read ten day plan secure wealth plant seed grow
thin rivulet strawberry ice cream escaped side stalin cone hand splatting onto carpet
curse tip stalin tongue remembered gulped glancing man behind counter
seeing guy safely reading paying no attention stalin soiling store cussing stalin turned back books pretty confused
studied christianity depth masters phd course along religions
may exciting reading world remembered plethora thick volumes theology christian thought
books little weighty kind use weight lifting around house ever thing
kinds books
shiny books stalin saw lined around bookstore seemed anything except christianity
anything told jesus
plop
stalin stared horror mushy pink mound left top cone slid onto floor one fluid motion falling soundless whoosh onto cherry red carpet
swear albeit breath jerked head heard soft chuckle coming nearby
spiky white high heels turned long legs flowery skirt tight lilac colored jacket
front stalin stood beautiful woman ever seen saying lot
hair fell waist chestnut brown shimmers red
twinkling eyes woman regarding stalin amusement first face intuited must shade lobster beet red flattened pile melting ice cream staining carpet
hot ice cream today remarked twisted waist gracefully pull packet tissues purse
worry carpet worn no one ever notice
like scooped fallen ice cream wad tissues tossed trash standing pillar middle small room
stalin felt mouth hang open raised hand saw long perfectly manicured nails painted lilac silver
importantly saw no wedding band
shannon amazing creature said holding one perfect hand towards stalin
father always loved ireland gave irish name
accent told stalin spanish however
forced close mouth reached shake hand one sticky ones
many smooth things say flooded stalin mind moment unexpectedly seemed place middle christian bookstore surrounded surreal sound churchy music floating stereo
instead said books talk something serious
feel like self help section bookstore

theological arguments jesus divine
stalin found taken aback shannon chuckled deep full throated laugh
find anything like said conspiratorial tone

shannon placed phone purse half turned towards door beginning walk
stalin took skirt legs high heels one millisecond took propel forward like dog hooked leash towards shannon daddy pastor tell jesus

rubber boot connected back rush light hit wide open eyes slamming pavement
rivers radiant colors stormed vision sami lifted head vaguely made city park crowds gathered absolutely silent
life lived surrounded multitudes today no one reached frenzied hands towards hope fingers briefly connect wild chords strummed electric guitar
no one rapturously snapping photos cell phone camera plotting show blurry concert images friends
sami eyes cleared enough realize encircled uniformed police bearing thick plexiglas shields synonymous riot control
formed writhing barrier crowd ominous warning anyone tried capture scene cell phone camera
still crowds stayed fixed eerily place behind police line silent
nearly ten years sami heard fans hysteric screams cheers accorded lead singer iran popular rock band ashavan
today baby blue sky sprayed cotton candy clouds last sound sami hear fans warily planted behind police park silence
today children raced slide distance ice cream man cart strolled gaping sami publicly beheaded
kneeling asphalt sami closed eyes felt watching sky spectator gruesomely comic event thirty year old literature major turned rock star sentenced beheading park list unpleasant crimes
sami knew really
something rustled behind sami snapped back reality
guard yanked cuffs around wrists checking arms secured
sami ankles also chained together often four months spent maximum security prison
get guard ordered dragging feet
slimy smudge perspiration marred young guard right eyebrow avoided prisoner eyes
obvious want

dozen feet away circled dreary ring hoary stones cement block protruded park square
murky stain began heart spreading snaking tentacles across surface block sides lifeblood spilled sun afternoon prayers past
sami stumbled bare feet barely aware sensation soles burning pavement
worn trendy italian leather shoes jeans paris cost three hundred euros
today sami feet bare bleeding
wore tattered cotton pants stained floor cell simple white shirt
shirt hung loosely frame muscles wasted away days nothing praying cell instead working elite gym club
even still towered two guards side tall broad shouldered
collective gasp rise myriad dark eyes staring park sami thought probably people gathered today barely recognized
sami mind
old sami gone different person
new sami mind standing barefoot dirty white sans ray bans without beautiful women following every move
minutes dressed pure white screaming name one made able sing first place
mon
sorry
young sweaty guard death grip sami arm named hourmazd
waiting hourmazd said reluctantly
come
sami felt feet slap across hot soiled square slow motion
next chipped concrete chopping block executioner waited crisp black uniform aviator ray bans gripping saudi arabian scimitar
attention steps behind two doctors white coats stood watching proceedings
one held dove gray tarp folded neat square wrap sami body
prison explained beheading body head carried doctors reattach two items bury sami full accordance islamic burial laws
none sami family intentions burying wayward relative christian manner
moment whether dead body laid ground facing mecca last thing sami mind
standing executioner block sami eyes blazed across gathered crowd one last time surprised see neither mother father witness gory sight
several feet behind one policemen opaque shields pale face peeped nondescript black chador veil
came
sami heart surged within stared taking last beauty ever see place called earth
met weeping eyes calmly intensely begging cry give away
see sister
time scanning solemn crowd hourmazd guard forced sami knees
hot fingers grabbed temple like vise twisting head one side plastering one cheek icy concrete
filmy coating dust pebbles settled onto block sami hand instinctively jerked forward swipe scratchy debris cheek pulled short biting metal cuffs
urgent hands still held kneeling sami realized facing crowd saw ava looking towards heaven

karate gone bad laid guitar case smooth tree stump among pines cried knowing trees hear
tears later stopped scrubbing face soft tiered skirt never one prolonged weeping

anyone every dropped ice cube back
well welcome relief pile snow
fortunately due superior intellect able recognize repetitive event caught five times
sixth dowsing snow pulled hood head
know know pure genius
isaacs plan climb simple
planned traverse cliff hundred feet point photo climb upper rock face diamond fifty feet climb onto steep snow slope
reached snow slope easy dangerous climbing summit
no problemo right
thought
admit
time making traverse diamond tired
hadnt worked conditioning well prior climb higher elevations really wearing
make matters worse didnt bring enough food water energy reserves pretty low
relief isaac led traverse hung back paid rope
felt good hang cliff bunch tiny slings instead making dangerous traverse sharp end rope called climbing
hung large block sheltered spindrift avalanches watched isaac pick way across cliff
little little alternated hands feet moved sideways relying hand footholds hold steep cliff
hanging cold winds howled
feel energy draining body minute
shivered uncontrollably shook hand knock warmth back
time seemed move slowly watched isaac cross traverse
every often isaac placed piece climbing gear rocks threaded rope
fell hed drop length past climbing gear instead feet
halfway across traverse isaac stopped
point called notch couloir
notch couloir wide break cliff ran nearly top mountain
far less steep viewing distance even considered mini valley carved top cliff
watched isaac stand like statue far front
didnt move
didnt look
didnt look around
stared straight ahead
come sally
grow balls move
freakin freezen remember thinking watched stand idly
world went white
enormous spindrift avalanche careened cliff face completely blocked view isaac
holy mackeral yelled didnt say mackerel
no sir lot snow enough fill couple large houses
felt rope go taut pulled hard take slack
scared
feel sickening feeling pit stomach envisioned isaac swept cliff avalanche
moment later last snowy dust floated see
isaac still standing saw last
rope gone taut due weight snow rushed
isaac swept away
dude see
yelled isaac never heard
saw isaac look toward notch couloir shuffle quickly across
facing mountain moved right foot right moved left foot match
isaac repeated sequence shuffling across cliff continued stare toward top
moved paid rope holding case lost footing slipped edge cliff
lifeline no idea hold weight event fall
watching cross looked full length foot cliff
high
due deteriorating conditions needed move faster place less gear route protection fall
hadnt really thought time analyze scene realized fall cliff almost certainly rip stance
felt damned scared buried fears concentrated job
moments later isaac made side snowy slope
suddenly heard loud whooosh
isaac gone
pulled hard rope locked belaying device
saw falling snow
mother spindrift avalanches creating white cloud snow rushed snowy face cliff

remember saying mind didnt say crap
braced tug figured isaac
seconds later rope went slack
snow clear isaac still clinging rocks side snow slope grinning ear ear
duuude see
isaac yelled across cliff face
rush beating tempest adrenaline pumping
see scared yet invigorated
man youre next yelled
sick feeling swept
indeed turn run gauntlet
looked around futile attempt avoid inevitable finally isaac yelled back
duuude got hurry
lets go yelled deep impatience voice
quickly dismantled anchors holding mountain started way across rock snowy cliff
hand hand reached anything grab time double checking isaac taking slack
rocky face cold light dusting snow
thin polypropylene gloves great temps forties temps hovering around zero rendering gloves almost useless
fingers cold cramping reached next handhold
become increasingly worried wasnt going able hold much longer
survival instincts kicked dug deep
throwing caution wind decided make risky moves across cliff face hoping hands wouldnt fail reaching snowy slope notch couloir
moved quickly deliberately awkward lunges continually held balance
heart pumping feel anxiety building closed distance snowy slope right
minute later hands giving made final step onto snow slope fell forward rested
good job dude cross couloir heard isaac yell lay rested
dream state heard yell got time avalanches

yelled disbelief
till moment hadnt realized amount snow falling
point cliff snow increased intensity heavy savage
snowflakes large accumulating rate nearly two feet hour
much unstable snow spindrift avalanches rolling notch couloir every fifteen seconds
crossing feet wide couloir take fifteen seconds moved fast
didnt result disastrous
much snow easily sweep cliff
perfect remember saying
no sooner wisecracked watched wall snow barreling roared snow slopes narrow valley
quickly dug hands feet snow hung
watched moment impact buried head shoulders braced terrifying wave snow
first snow flowed like gentle stream water didnt last long
split second later felt full force wall snow raged top
taunted laughed mocked insignificant strength pushed dragged lower dug position
feel hands feet ripped anchors focused energy trying embed hard packed snow
began slide felt unmistakable tug rope climbers harness yanking sideways isaac fought keep malevolent force dragging cliff
nooo remember screaming mind feet broke free solid land floated space
going cliff edge cliff edge perched feet world

feeling around located tiny crack slipped point axe
weighted moved right foot onto diamonds face
half body hanging feet air straddling hairy edge raging fear

suddenly wild blast arctic wind slammed body rocking stance
feet skidded momentarily one popped placement
quickly found another foot hold another gust wind slammed knocking feet loose
instant dangling ice axes foot cliff swinging wildly wind
fear roiled inside
lost breath frantically searched feat type purchase
fumbling freaking fatiguing running strength running time
needed miracle
bam
another gust broadsided
left axe wobbled popped feeble placement

flailed air made desperate attempt hook axe anything hold
isaac tugged drew corner
reached blocky face scrambled feet find something stand
suddenly foot found something nob tiny nob
stepped immediately pushed hard forcing closing isaac
moment held didnt
sprung cliff dangling wildly thrashing wind
feel veins neck pulsating savage fear
felt like hours mere seconds enough drain mental physical strength
barely hold longer
isaac tugged hard
made another desperate lung free hand
axe caught edge stuck
feet found stance
moment
found respite
isaac somehow hauled face diamond pulled around corner standing feet blocky face
breath strength mind jump backward dropped snow slope next isaac
collapsed tiny crater rested
duuude watch man avalanche
isaac hollered
moving instinct alone rolled onto stomach dug frozen hands deep snow planted boots
buried face snow waited
thick violent wave rolled top isaac stood firmly held rope
fought hard position no match forces nature
little strength left ripped position dragged slope toward edge cliff
abruptly slide came stop snow fought push
felt wave avalanche dissipate looked investigate predicament
standing teeth clenched stood isaac
arms outstretched hauled back rope prevented slide cliff
going lay lollygagging night
isaac shouted wind
quickly jumped feet plowed deep snow ascending short distance
think

point tired anything belay back across snow slope
darkness finally come snows raging reducing visibility near whiteout conditions
isaac ascended higher slope waited next avalanche pass
even rush dissipated started side
paid rope frozen finger plowed way deep snow
forty feet thirty feet isaac moved determination
nearly halfway mark heard scream wind
hold
isaac caught avalanche
blizzards intensity heightened dumping even greater amounts snow onto upper regions
resultant snow created spindrift avalanched greater quantity ferocity
isaac jumped ground burrowed quickly late
wave snow rolled knocking backward dragging mountain
hold hold
heard scream barely audible twenty feet
pulled hard watched desperation continued slide toward edge cliff
slid isaac rolled onto stomach pounded hands feet snow desperately trying anchor slope
downward slipped twenty feet fifteen feet ten feet toward edge cliff
boots seemed mere feet going
wave slowed isaacs descent
jumped tried swim higher slope
seconds later jumped back buried limbs snows around
pulled hard rope holding inevitable
like malevolent entity snow raged top threatening punishing presence mountain
isaac fought life began downward slide toward cliff
fifteen feet ten feet five feet
watched horror feet broke crust snow defined cliffs edge
isaacs feet dangling air

isaac yelled side
gods nature smiled upon
timed avalanches correctly sprang across snow slope like gazelle
remember look relief isaacs eyes stepped beside barely making past next avalanche series

following day june seventh day battle morgan woke early restful night sleep one many cannons aimed city

instantly fresh clear morning air became heavy cloud smoke stung eyes seared nostrils foul stench sulfur powder quickly burned discharged breech cannon deafening cacophony cannon soldier startled birds jarred wildlife morning routine instinctively sending scrambling cover
well trained soldiers began work
groups three one loaded powder wadding one loaded shell heavy ball third lit charge
machine working perfect sequence timing efficiently deliver unto enemy deadly payload
whistling air shells cannonballs picked particulates dust small flying insects arced across valley toward chattanooga killing anything path reaching final destination
valley became awake
loud cannon fire signaled sharpshooters unleash deadly volley destruction
reflex pulled triggers sent tiny yet deadly pieces lead individual paths doom quickly reloaded weapons practiced speed
second think
startled jolt town confederate soldiers stood place minds tried quickly process disbelief forthcoming death
unable move heard whistle air projectiles hurled toward
backs volley waited listened whistle grew quickly louder thunderous rush air
facing volley watched disbelief quickly trained eyes direction sound watching heavy ball tiny bullets disrupt air front impact
fate misfortune collided shell flesh
group drilling confederate soldiers first volley hit mark deadly accuracy
one unlucky private watched horror shell found mark chest unlucky companion marching front
shell tore uniform flesh ribcage instantly killing even shell internal mechanisms sensed pressure impact
great explosion canister fragmented thousands tiny projectiles completely disintegrating whole soldiers existence
no burial remnant left body
continuing way fragments exploded shell found next victim watching soldier
hot pieces metal tore body severed extremities well buried molten metal chest
deflected yet still deadly fragments found victims around location impact sending blood torn limbs shredded body parts fellow soldiers
lucky escaped initial impact concussion shockwave explosion ruptured eardrums disorienting rendering useless
shells exploded around stunned helpless soldiers gory results affected devastating loss entire company
along waterfront confederate soldiers unloading supplies met fate drilling comrades
shells fell around exploding thousands fragments tearing bodies killing closest impact maiming impairing others away epicenter
cries agony heard fell
union sharpshooters unleashed hail shot balls lead sailed air awful shrill telegraphing intentions
bullets found mark tearing gray cloth violently ripping flesh bone creating large gaping wounds germs disease enter body unrestricted
collapsing ground many screamed agony clutching bleeding wounds desperate attempt relieve pain death quickly overcame
others lay torment hypovolemic shock quickly enveloped bodies loss blood
around city first barrage munitions inflicted devastating damage
confederate encampment targeted loading docks river telegraph offices livery stables blacksmith shops also targeted
anything used confederates cause targeted first volley union fire
within seconds first discharge union rifles cannons another round quickly sounded followed third fourth volley
murderous fire seemed unrepulsed first slowly confederate soldiers wounded others targeted withdrew regrouped form defensive line various points around city
determined anger positioned behind breastwork wagons supplies band confederates located sources gunfire coming opposite side river higher foothills unleashed first many volleys retaliation repel
union soldiers lay stomachs reloaded heard sound lead crashing branches thickets confederates searched targets trial error
next round union sharpshooters confederates lay dead wounded volley came pinpointing unions exact positions
orders aim low confederates returned fire lower banks river
cries pain agony testified confederates skill several union soldiers lay dead permanently maimed slowly reducing effective force
confederates union soldiers defensive scrambled moment regrouping smaller fighting force
unbeknownst union command beyond city limits confederates loaded several cannons
tucked away grove tall oaks protection elements easily missed opposing force
quickly three man teams loaded cannons took careful aim union battery
command fire confederates opened union forces staged foothills signal mountain
visibility drastically reduced repeated cannon fire union forces struggled see targets
time union artillery brigade saw heavy smoke confederate volley late
scream fragmentation canisters telegraphed arrival union soldiers stand watch horror tiny projectiles grew larger vision speed leaving little else stand watch impending death
first four canisters roared camp impacted ground two cannon batteries immediately exploding tiny shards twisted molten metal
instantly thousands fragments traveled point impact found first victims two union soldiers stood two cannons
within blink eye bodies absorbed fragments nearly obliterating proof existence
blood bone splattered two cannons characteristically horrific pattern death destruction
fragments deflected ricocheted objects human metallic destruction devastating killing maiming nine union soldiers
split second later two canisters roared first two impacting bluff union cannoning
although projectiles embedded earth exploded destructive intention denied
soil heaved broke apart sending large amounts fast moving granules dirt pebbles toward union battery ripping flesh maiming several union men hard work force knocking ground agonizing pain
last canister rocketed heads union soldiers hit birch tree high trunk exploding instantly amputating upper half lower
crash tree hit ground went unnoticed union forces turned destructive force onto cloud confederate smoke far beyond chattanooga
wave sword gen negley bellowed order silence cannons far edge town
quickly teams three jockeyed cannons toward fading confederate smoke calculated angle trajectory lit charges
repositioned cannons came life muzzles spewed fire smoke metallic death recoil sending reeling backward restraints
seconds later far beyond city proper primary explosions seen shells hit targets followed several secondary explosions signaling destruction enemy ammo caches ignited result primary detonation
violently jolted lazy stare river young boy sitting elevated boulder fishing breakfast nearly fell water reflex loud explosions
quickly gathered things jumped rock rock desperately fleeing cover
still bank river found two large boulders hide behind giving safe cover violent exchange
closer action two bedraggled trappers upon hearing deafening explosions killing countrymen quickly deduced safe escape continue poling river
attempt make land might expose combatants draw fire either side
grabbed poles even harder strained push tiny raft faster river
hand hand pushed flimsy poles nearly breaking rushed evade harms way
painful blisters formed quickly broke leaving fresh blood along length poles continued push lives
standing left side raft without warning single stray bullet whistled air impacted back first trappers head
lead ball mushroomed shattered skull propelling bone brain blood front tattered clothes river
instantly fell overboard floated downstream
shock witnessing death companion remaining trapper cried anguish helplessly watched friend floating away trailing behind path red water
reality snapped back focus another bullet embedded one logs raft fracturing sending tiny splinters water
looked back pelts beaver muskrat deceased friend toiled previous two months
hesitated moment grabbed handful beaver pelts rifle tiny strongbox money quickly jumped water
struggling stay afloat weight rifle kicked boots wildly water
head dipped surface let go rifle feet touched bottom
pushed muddy floor river popped head water took gasp air sunk water
finding bottom river launched waterlogged body surface gasped another breath air
sank back water head water line
managed move close enough shore wade toward land handful belongings safe
spotting large boulder rivers edge made way toward keeping head mostly submerged cover
boulder threw pelts strongbox onto higher ground positioned rifle defense
powder wet useless still aimed weapon hoping called bluff
shaking scared young boy huddled close rock witnessed drama trappers unfold upriver
tender age seven never seen man killed sight old trapper violent death shook core
world changed instant graphic vision imprinted memory forever
openly wept watched remains old man drift slowly downstream past
union corporal amol fletcher part three man team assigned artillery standing post first four confederate shells exploded
fighting two cannons away blast sent shrapnel team decapitating one private missing took large fragment lower leg nearly severing calf bone
instantly dropped ground agony
cried pain clutched dangling flesh irrationally trying reattach bone
delirium world seemed slow
no one noticed lay sprawled ground cannons
bullets passed head heard whistle moment forgot injury sense self preservation overtook

pulling arms pushing uninjured leg slowly worked way cannon soldier dragging trail blood behind
hypovolemic shock began develop loss blood pain gaping wound became less noticeable

fear anxiety coursed veins struggled stay alive
desperately deliberately stretched hands front clawing anything use escape
crawled elevation dropped slightly allowing protection bullets passing
grass mud embedded fingernails reached larger boulder pulled around safety lying stomach rolled sat smooth granite rock
heard sound bullets ricocheting boulder deflecting trees around instinctively ducked sound
adrenaline pumping reached grass dirt stained shirt ripped strip bottom edge
taking strip hands lifted hanging flesh secured bone cloth tying loose knot hold calf place pain caused scream reflex
short distance away private pulling horse drawn ambulance heard painful shriek corporal fletcher thunder war
first pass searched casualties
hearing horrific screams snapped reins team horses quickly located suffering corporal barely conscious still feeling agony

sixteenth summer made mental resolution island impenetrable aloof using others convenience nothing
pain thing cared life casting aside fork road one possible future involved love trust led path alone suspicious always guard
first time life hed opened entrusted jasmine heart repaid spitting face trouble
rigid training provided solution never allow anyone get close never reveal true self never care
found philosophy useful afforded relief time confused pain

hed signed months seventeenth birthday although new paperwork put age eighteen half
necessary artifice selection name start anew without baggage past
young man calling raul terenova good supposed
names unimportant
disposable everything life
raul excelled brutal training conditions truth told kinder relaxed ones hed imposed upon years
learned lot especially explosives side
nothing like military proffer kind training couldnt get civilian life no matter
goal expert every aspect combat special forces teach tenacity discipline hed quickly climbed top class established records
became model men follow demanding anything trainers mustered
young raul far motivated classmates get service years
viewed time military stepping stone whereas peers go career soldiers
becoming naval commando idea hed grown fixated sixteen reading services plans create group super soldiers
didnt burning desire become marine going excel field hed contemplating skills valuable
none told recruiting officer
navy hed presented fiercely patriotic young man wanted escape dull existence home rural chiapas uniform get instant respect life adventure action
basic training stood far quality green recruits
scores written exams floored instructors
candidate blisteringly smart swim like fish shoot like marksman physical prowess professional athlete
no question moving ahead queue putting specialized marine training became obvious one new elite commandos
today working specialized sniping long range considered anything thousand meters almost thirty three hundred feet
extreme distances variety elements came play including wind strength direction humidity temperature elevation rate movement wasnt stationary target
recorded instances snipers successfully killing twenty four hundred meters considered anomalies
sixteen hundred meters target mile away
hit distance accuracy considered virtually impossible impossibly small group expert marksmen although advents like laser rangefinders computer software calculate various elements improved odds
days exercise targets confirmed distance thousand meters roughly three quarters mile
rifle using exercise american manufactured barrett m82 caliber rifle effective range eighteen hundred meters although accuracy became iffy nine hundred thousand meters
sixteen hundred meters considered acceptable trying hit bomb something larger human torso many variables affect accuracy
many snipers preferred smaller caliber rifles precision official sniper rifle marines heckler koch psg1 firing millimeter round
problem weapons accuracy dropped eight hundred meters special forces secured fifteen much larger payload barrett rifles trial standardization substitute smaller psg1
sniper cadet assigned coach gave firing order received report field
accuracy dropped markedly seven hundred meter threshold crossed deliver precise hits eight hundred
nose tell
coach asked raul
moderate humidity
guesstimate wind speed direction
seven ten knots north east raul replied
temperature
thirty degrees celsius
going without computer
purely based observations
youre confident observations adjust bearings accordingly
good luck coach said stepped back leaving young man
raul concentrated controlling breathing soon entire awareness synthesized tiny world within scope
made minor corrections wind speed guesstimate gently massaged trigger weapon fired slamming shoulder considerable recoil
hed long ago learned never pull trigger throw accuracy
deliberate squeeze best
radio crackled report came back
bulls eye
good shooting
repeated exercise ten shots landed within ten inch grouping
think done young man
impressive shooting
raul looked coach
emboldened success wanted try personal best
got along well man floated idea
dont try fifteen hundred meters
make interesting
raul suggested
coach looked like crazy
pretty cocky huh
thats impossible range weapon ammo mention scope
want put money
coach asked
fifteen hundred meters mile away near absolute maximum rifles range human sized target
two hundred pesos says nail three five
although agree ammo crap distance
prefer load better consistency hey raul said
fine
three misses go home two hundred richer
coach got radio issued instructions man downrange obligingly moved target farthest point field taking cover
funeral
fire ready coach said
raul took time made adjustments scope repeated meditation process became one weapon
discharge almost startled focused concentration
no need wait radio report
knew say
bulls eye twenty centimeters center radio crackled
right left
low high
tell specific
raul groused
wide eyed coach studied raul like another planet posed question
response came back
right
thats thought hed say
winds died hair last thirty seconds
tell clear raul said
got go ahead repeated impossible shot
four times
shots grouped foot variance
coach gladly handed two hundred pesos single astounding display marksmanship hed ever witnessed
youre fucking monster know
thats superhuman voodoo shit right
ive never seen anything like ive teaching ten years
one top three marksmen mexico coach acceded studying kind wonder
men laughed together spite twenty five year age difference
raul never shoot accuracy distance preferring limit performance average expectations
wouldnt show develop much reputation
better one million day graduate top third class top
remembered emilios sage counsel sprout
never show much hand
give enemies information make gift
friends become enemies
know good take private pleasure accomplishment
becoming celebrated makes target
better middle herd hunters come head
evening raul enjoyed place spotlight amongst peers news exploit circulated
much enjoyed adulation part knew hubris came best fickle charm resolved enjoy last time allowed others get glimpse actually
information power allowing no inviting others understand capabilities foolhardy
goal drain experience service slip away like ghost
serve no useful purpose noticed already
point adopt lower profile continue accumulate pearls experience work done
calculated another three months training perhaps six months field sufficient making total year half life devoted pursuit excellence mexicos finest
night lay head upon bunk began silent mental countdown
begin new new life
patience told virtue pay enormous dividends became bedtime mantra
needed maximize learning still school
thats viewed life point hed arrived education
time soon come pupil proved master lessons absorb
still wanted learn special operations parachuting jumping planes controlling descent rather precision guiding drop within meter target point high altitude low required different skills
still needed hours scuba time well orientation flying planes helicopters
latter two werent curriculum lobbying get added

first plan use subterfuge approach vessel several plain clothed men command subdue two lookouts stun guns move bulk commandos swiftly dock gangplank boarding old scow anyone knew happened
raul questioned logic involved didnt say anything
operation approached half dozen well armed divers waterside used lines climb side ship alternatively taken two smoking sentries harbor end dock firing waterline killing instantly moving squad onto pier water nobody expecting attack

going gun battle youd want pick distance engaged wisely order able hold assailants made escape
hed high speed tender secured ships stern get away contingency also man watching water approach case
never ever really knew expect unexpected
wasnt place second guess superiors interested see exercise play
gave marines less twenty percent chance taking ship without battle meant hed see real action
finally
albeit distance truth preferred
hed long ago concluded far safer sniping afar hero rushing hail slugs
leave peers
hed pick targets surgical precision knew hit
two large norwegian wharf rats scurried dock away ship two smoking men

glad wasnt ass line one
perhaps instead sea approach raul might flight four six men parachute touching rear ship taking sentries descended
virtually anything direct assault dock
no wonder military casualties drug wars high
operational plans amounted brandishing saber screaming charge
little expectation anything blood bath
didnt envy fellow commandos duty tonight
no way go well
adjusted scope compensate stiffening wind calculate distance laser rangefinder
six hundred seventy four meters
like shooting fish barrel thought allowing private luxury small smile
face like fellow commandos blacked camouflage paint avoid giving shine lending profile evil glint akin escaped demon
smile anything reassuring
commander gave signal two undercover men exited building one holding bottle mescal hand talking loudly inebriated slur
given no way wouldnt spotted bright idea friendly drunken dock workers two smoking guards dispatched pretend engage scuffle security guards come running break fight
six men total gangplank theyd breach ship pour building reinforce
addition stun guns men dock equipped grenades machine pistols bogus security guards presumption take ship surprise keep foe engaged main body commandos made dock
two vehicles waiting race filled armed men gangplank fifteen seconds time signal given
seemed like suicide raul wasnt job craft better plan
shoot perfectly positioned
may first assault enough common sense understand even commandos prevailed prevail eventually due vastly larger numbers cost human life high sides whereas surgical strike accomplished much result minimal special forces casualties
inefficient offended sense symmetry anything
watched two men staggered way pier returned full attention bridge
pair undercover operatives time made two sentries sight bridge due angle hull
unless course two guards moved case plan disaster alternatively need aborted
walking headfirst killing zone generally bad strategy anywhere world mexico couldnt see commander barreling forward plan doomed failure
least hoped
sentry exterior bridge carrying machine pistol sort looked like uzi raul
meant limited useful range accuracy
uzi antiquated design effective range two hundred meters fine typical close quarter urban combat lousy applications requiring accuracy distance
better popular choice far raul concerned kalashnikov akm modernized version venerated double effective range single fire mode least three hundred meters fired full auto probably best weapon personal favorite dependability accuracy mid range assault rifle american built
five hundred meter effective range extremely high muzzle velocity made ideal choice assault applications compensated relatively small slug size
hed fired three emilio years disassemble reassemble matter seconds knew whereof spoke
luck wasnt going well far
two smoking sentries dock moved toward men engagement take place plain sight bridge

seconds shit hit fan slid two full magazines next rifle quickly change empty
man bridge still biggest concern
made mental note always carry one magazine full jacketed armor piercing rounds case needed slice inch metal reinforced glass
show time
fixed bridge target crosshairs waited instruction
commander watching approach liking saw
like raul understood bridge sentries werent caught unawares assault become slaughterhouse men taking heavy casualties
struggling internal debate commander murmured com system
one two men dock earpiece upon hearing commanders instructions grabbed friend turned around noticing two smoking men cautiously approaching
mission aborted
shit commander hissed began pacing mulling choices
theyd probably pull armored vehicles hard way shooting no element surprise
raul bit tongue decided advance idea purely interests keeping role assault interesting getting practical experience
taking single sentry almost thousand meters wasnt really much challenge
single shot
maybe two send someone find armor piercing rounds
sir
might word
raul asked
commander regarded surprise
raul one best men never spoke
loner no close relationships within corps
isnt great moment
yes sir
know sir
observation came watching target may use sir raul explained sucking pride taking expected supplicant tone
well
make quick commander barked
need coordinate frontal assault goes much longer
permission approach sir
get
raul moved commanders side spoke low calm tone explaining ideas arguing amphibian assault
commander listened carefully cut forty five seconds
require far stealth luck weve tonight
good strategy appreciate sharing dont think afford waste two hours preparing
no think well good old fashioned frontal assault take punches
end wed one anyway plan failed call cut chase commander declared summarily dismissing idea
raul considered arguing point decided didnt care much
hed still get shoot couple bad guys least care end half squad got mowed
yes sir
thank hearing sir
going frontal please get magazine armor piercing rounds
theyll come handy take gunman inside bridge raul requested
commander nodded called com one team members waiting next building
twenty minutes
youll
well move thirty
commander spun around began issuing orders preparation brute force assault
theyd need couple armored personnel carriers enough carry forty men
ordered two unimog armored trucks two btr armored carriers eight wheeled vehicles accommodate seven commandos along three man crew operate turret mounted heavy machine gun smaller machine gun
fallback plan much straightforward
drive ship
deploy men no firing takes place seize ship
sentries crew decided shoot blast away everything sight shoot way ship crew either surrendered dead
inelegant result lot bullets flying benefit simplicity
twenty five minutes later young commando approached raul handed magazine five rounds armor piercing caliber bullets apologizing couldnt find short notice
raul thanked emptied half one spare magazines counting five shells replacing five armor piercing rounds
ejected current bullet rifle chambered one new armor piercing cartridges returned watching sentries night vision scope
commander checked watch precisely three forty ordered assault everything happened quickly
two gray btr 70s resembled small tanks anything else rumbled around corner onto pier followed two hulking trucks
sentries dock froze staring numb disbelief apparition hurriedly scuttled gangplank disappeared ship
one mans head reappeared seconds gangplank collapsed onto concrete pier
crash almost immediately followed steel watertight door slamming shut boom
barred within grinding cogs audible halfway dock even baritone growl vehicles
going considerably harder take freighter traffickers forewarned
easy access ship gangplank gone commandos dock siege situation ship whose hull rose easily four stories pier no obvious entry point available
commander watched kind frozen frustration shooting started gunmen emerged interior ship moved edge hull began firing behind protection heavy steel hardy old vessel built
raul took situation moments waiting right instant squeezed trigger
guns boom deafening
ears ringing watched satisfaction sentry standing outside bridge man inside collapsed
hed timed fired outside man directly front man inside bridge effectively killing two birds one armor piercing stone
no reason waste precious ammo
swiveled attention hull make heads popping like nocturnal version whack mole fairground stall
man wearing baseball cap leaned railing fired weapon vehicles
raul caressed trigger watched shooters head vaporized
moving line waited opening took another
four three shells felt fair contribution ensuing train wreck operation
raul peered scope trying find obvious targets gunmen along side ship figured sniper work retreated superstructure barring watertight deck entry door process
gun turrets btr 70s opened armor piercing rounds quickly discovered shells easily penetrate one half inch steel plate denting massive hull fashioned considerably thicker material
left commandos traffickers classic mexican standoff
shooting ship stopped lone gunman hadnt made inside time behind bulk bridges tower rauls line sight
firing two btr 70s also stopped though entire waterfront area still resonated receding echoes gunfire
commander barked orders radio men emptied personnel carriers took position mount assault
men flung three grappling hooks affixed black nylon rope hulls edge
four pronged hooks found purchase
problem men ropes got caught fire remaining gunman dead meat nobody wanted first climb four stories onto deck
raul decided shift position moved row warehouse windows symmetrically placed see entire length ship
set rifle tripod careful jar weapon resumed peering scope
farthest end ship right near stern gunman taking cover three foot high lip boats deck edge
raul calculated distance added additional forty yards adjusted accordingly waited mans head pop back
matter time figured correctly turned vigilance rewarded mans arms head coming view prepared empty weapon commandos
raul took shot mans head dissolved bloody spray fragments
deck empty although still ugly fighting ship
problem
commander gave squad clear signal within seconds commandos moving swiftly ropes ship
raul shifted attention bridge windows figuring matter time bright lad figured shoot portholes stretched another four stories ships deck picking soldiers climbed rail
sure enough one glass hatches side opened gun barrel poked
waited patiently angle shooters barrel wouldnt allow hit deck sure enough weapon slowly emerged window raul also saw arm holding
first commandos feet edge second theyd exposed gunman
raul fired assault rifle tumbled harmlessly deck taking three quarters mans still attached arm
give rest inside something think
textbook incursion
use explosives blow doors open fifteen minutes bursts gunfire echoed throughout boats hull
eventually commander got clear call men inside status report
theyd taken six hostiles no survivors lost nine men process
raul listened recitation impassively face betraying nothing
commander glanced heard casualty assessment raul busy packing gear work night finished
commander approached stopped feet away studying silent sniper finished stowing weapon long padded case
great shooting
saved lot lives tonight commander said
raul bit tongue didnt blurt natural reaction hed allowed lead amphibian team likely lost men thanks element surprise commander killed commandos lack flair imagination surely hed pulled trigger
instead nodded stood shouldering rifle case hoisting bag
thank sir
lucky shots tonight
fortunate
nothing say saluted free hand descending stairs join remainder team
long stretch duty bodies recovered drugs inventoried wanted get commanders sight contempt man leaked veneer
wasnt worth
world composed idiots commander simply one dolt many nothing raul said change things
night first live operation realized hed probably already learned everything going military
time already come little year service reconsider options
chapter ten years ago sinaloa mexico eighteen months joining marines raul disappeared without trace leaving nothing behind remembered except assumed name hed quickly grown despise
hed participated seven operations first one mission became convinced talents wasted wasnt progressing
make matters worse witnessed countless acts bumbling bureaucracy ranking officers costing men command casualties no good reason
anything ever convinced wouldnt well working someone else half year active duty completing boot camp specialized training done trick
walked base last time ostensibly two days leave go visit fictional family chiapas audible sigh relief
raul saved almost meager pay still thousand dollars money hed left home selling weapons convert assets cash
identity papers cost six hundred dollars mexico city hed done odd jobs joining navy need put next part grand plan operation fairly soon going avoid work day laborer
fortunately cartels hed battling generous employers able pay far navy pretty much choose cartel wanted approach marine theyd eager part enforcement team
although different ideas service
three months shy nineteenth birthday free pleased
yet unfinished business needed attend back sinaloa moved next phase life
departure stuck craw felt pull return hed told completely jasmine truth part always assumed rejection sort youthful power play shed get see reason time
whether deluded wishful thinking needed put behind time hands mature perspective decided return old haunts see things sat
hed learned trust judgment things hopped bus began long trip veracruz culiacan
wearing uniform special forces commando afforded privilege bus company thankfully cost almost nothing cross nation
two days hed left naval career behind descended stairs culiacan blinking bright sunlight early spring day
forty two hours cramped buses eating whatever junk get irregular stops first order business decent meal
set search restaurant favorite back day
outside terminal hailed cab reciting address memory driver slid back seat
young man changed since hed last town city growing leaps bounds
carefully trimmed goatee closely cropped military haircut ensured nobody recognize wasnt much issue considering long absence
hed developed hardened combat veteran since leaving teen boy bearing additional muscle weight filled uniform lending formidable presence
boy left returned man
taxi arrived restaurant chuparrosa enamorada nestled banks canal rosales
young man paid driver stepped onto pavement hoisting duffle studied restaurant faade
tuesday breakfast business thin wouldnt case weekend
place typically standing room crowd saturdays sundays due generous portions mouthwatering food soothing waterside ambiance
times emilio special occasions one things mind since boarding bus veracruz
entered large dining room boots thumping saltillo tile floor waitress approached invited outdoor table overlooking water
cursory glance familiar menu ordered glass orange juice plate chicken chilaquiles red sauce local favorite one restaurants signature dishes
waited food come thought next move glancing around absently remarked little things changed last twenty months
sleepy area things seemed always remain even city grew unprecedented rate
waitress arrived heaping platter breakfast tucked ran mental list
first thing need secure reliable transportation
taxis werent going option mind hed need get sort conveyance sooner rather later
bankroll thin meant stealing something probably several somethings depending far decided travel
munched food savoring rich spicy sauce cleaned plate efficiently dishwasher
stuffed paid bill strolled onto rural road scanning surroundings something liberate opportunistically
took half hour spot suitable vehicle easy enough break hotwire eventually found thirty year old chevrolet truck broken wind wing
within seconds cab scanning surrounding street ensure hadnt detected
took ten seconds find ignition wires soon meandering familiar road led miguels estate
landscape still verdant wild nature seemingly impatient encroach slim progress man introduced
quarter mile turnoff ranch pulled old truck onto dirt track led wilds parked couldnt seen road
no idea find hacienda made estate hed learned cautious everything considered best err side prudence
moved stealthily woods found one myriad game trails ran immense tract miguels property soon jogging along old days
cool february barely broke sweat moved effortlessly foliage
long cluster trees ran along side property near horse barn hed long ago set move hay commencement training
paused momentarily ears straining hint habitation detected nothing
main house deserted none security men everywhere hed living
no matter hadnt come anything house
wanted see mentor emilio course daughter
efforts jasmine survived place shed carved psyche wanted bring closure door bulged threatened burst open recurring dreams
young man continued along perimeter track reached caretakers house reposed several hundred yards woods
knew trail like hed yesterday loosely placed flagstone served driveway familiar feet
surprisingly felt buzz anxiety pit stomach neared front door altogether alien sensation
sitting always modest colonial home deliberately styled rustic sponge painted manner mirror design sensibility larger main house absent flamboyant frills
pausing front porch registered something different home last time hed seen almost two years ago
seemed quiet though nobody living much like main estate appeared distance
shaking sense foreboding knocked door heard nothing inside walked around side emilio parked big navy blue ford lobo crew cab truck
sat unchanged next small chevy econo box emilio bought jasmine bonuses miguel
moved back onto porch knocked

jasmine leaned forward see face dim light
one side jasmine remembered
beautiful serene tears streaming freely cheek
side face abomination
acid seared living flesh blinded ruined resembled something dragged road miles trapped fire something human
tendons ligaments exposed even two years horrific event suppurating wet sorea picture hell earth incarnate
young man seen plenty death savagery life even shocked automatically recoiled sight
horrible thing hed ever seen
felt gag reflex triggering pit stomach dropped
god jasmine nothing say
no words anyone say make better

another round tequila beer hastily arrived altamar waved waitress moments earlier
service staff didnt need ask kind always

altamar liked familiar veritable drinking machine every friday saturday night
cousins invariably struggled keep hour got late deterred one iota
hed private party later pair youthful minxes accompanying
two cousins eyed envious admiration even vision began blur
girls much going happening end night theyd fall dazed bed room spinning companions best entertain
altamar hand reputation insatiable likely helped plentiful chemical supplementation lavished upon

altamar stood unsteadily stabilizing table woozily moved rear club office private restroom

rolled hundred dollar bill snorted gusto wincing delicious burn drug hit septum
augmentation complete moved bathroom opened door
failed notice shadow dark room quiet rustle excruciating pain lanced head everything went dark
fifteen minutes later cousins realized altamar gone long time staggered back office check
door locked wasnt unexpected
men pounded calling
getting no response multiple efforts went found two altamars security detail swiftly broke door guns drawn
office pitch black
turned lights confronted empty room
sober cousins went window pulled blinds yelled two guards pointing opening
three iron bars window cut either welding torch sort acid bent right angles creating space large enough body fit
music stopped two minutes later
fiesta abruptly terminated
armed men milled uncertain cousin discovered window issued instructions raced vehicles
altamar faded consciousness unsure happening
bouncing hard surface felt cool air blowing sense motion
struggled move wrists ankles bound tape mouth
opened eyes wider couldnt make anything something blocking vision
arm hurt upper bicep like hed shot last thought faded someone injected something knock
eventually altamar returned full awareness time see albeit without much clarity
blinked eyes futile effort clear head splitting blow
tried reach touch tender spot discovered move arm inches extended slightly shoulder level
tried arm also extended met resistance
fully alert respiration increased flooded sense panic
tried move legs encountered problem immobilized spread eagled arms legs stretched wide
nose registered musty odor long abandoned horse stalls vision returned near normal see indeed old barn chained floor
continued struggle minutes blood began tricking wrists hed torn skin pulling chains
dim light came pair headlights outside closed barn door slim illumination crept around sides base
altamar screamed hoarse croak anything largely due effects vocal cords whatever hed dosed

fire immediately spread began roar soon entire barn ablaze
inspecting work quiet satisfaction young man spun walked door pausing kick altamar groin moved past
wouldnt filthy parasite passing
hed want full attention phase remained short life
fire licked barn door windows started trucks engine
moments obvious altamar wasnt going make
shame really
almost better somehow managed survive
life mangled condition fitting punishment hed done jasmine family
deal deal hed kept word
slid transmission reverse pulled away
nothing left see
truck approached small house rolled stop engine going silent driver side door opened
young man moved homes entrance expertly picked lock
inside crept soundlessly main bedroom jasmine sleeping
hed tortured since hed seen face
even getting revenge vicious brutality knew life going continue miserable nightmare
nobody help
hed gladly leave two million dollars thought second medicine fix face anything resembling normalcy knew impossibility
another example cruel unpredictable universe punishing innocents making every moment tortured farce
watched lay breathing fitfully ravaged profile constant reminder pain shed endured pulled pistol belt shot head
ten minutes later sat hood truck watching house burn embers blowing pre dawn carried jasmines soul
reasoned thing hell going anyway willing carry burden ending suffering couldnt
winced roof collapsed propane stove provided ample fuel get blaze started
single tear trickled way cheek lonely offering world brutalized children savaged meek
shoulders shuddered cried jasmine unfairness pointlessness everything
eventually sorrow exhausted gruffly rubbed moisture face shirt sleeve getting behind wheel driving away
still much done bemoan existence later
solomon valiente sat office furniture store ranchero music humming forth showroom speakers attempt lure pedestrians wondering gimmick overture unknown
hed gotten strange call hour earlier indicating stranger wanted speak important matter urgency
rubbed neck absently fingering heavy gold links held crucifix never removed
gestured two men standing door allow young man enter office
valiente one main rivals altamars iron hold empire well known hated drug lord furious close family members killed altamars goons power struggle miguels holdings underway

rey checked high end hotel town sat small rectangular table room going details three targets
didnt see problem taking get progressively harder word purge spread
ideally night logistics wouldnt accommodate reconciled hed lucky get two third schedule following day
jotted addresses decided go drive reconnoiter neighborhoods see dealing
valiente supplied plentiful information targets security hopefully no surprises wanted determine anything valiente missed
need different vehicle truck buy something preferably alarm dependable considering driving around two million cash
thursday evening headed part town new car dealers lots closed
lucky salesman get dream handed
rey drove toyota dealer hour emerged keys shiny new black runner factory alarm

first target manuel remarosa piece cake
second hit wouldnt easy knew
man lived hour outside culiacan large parcel land one entry heavily guarded private road
no point driving picked weapons returned hotel called valiente confirmed everything

valientes security men kept watchful eye threats chatted snack rey transferred golf bag weapons lobo
heading look second third targets homes confirmed instinct two three night best modified strategy accordingly
time made back hotel ten night tired checking weapons loading took two hour cat nap
slumber world good one parked quarter mile manuel remarosas opulent home
use beretta exercise hoped hed able get without fire assault rifle
pistol relatively silent opening automatic rifle draw considerable undesired attention
rey dressed head toe dark gray army surplus camouflage nearly invisible slid silently brush periphery estate

one breakfast patio sight rest weak link
reys plan neutralize man simply walk house make way targets bedroom deed
no time gunmen idea happened
hurdle cross expanse open space brush house without detected
hed need time perfectly avoid getting firefight
kind spur moment operation depended entirely element surprise
preferred plan future hits carefully hed handed means begin career bang hed needed done
problem watched house couldnt see means reach without alarming guard bringing full wrath four armed men
sucked need modify plan reflect reality
hed thought one angles keep hidden almost right guard brush discovered illusory
calculating next move hunkered wait figuring long night
manuel remarosa stretched four poster bed rolled morning light window wouldnt wake anymore already
sadie golden retriever ideas hearing master shift bed decided time send message undying love form sloppy wet kisses face
jumped onto mattress manuel wife gloria firmly deposited lavishing beloved master affection
manuel swatted halfheartedly rolling towards window resigned fate
couldnt really get angry sadie shed sleeping bed since tiny puppy six weeks since turned one year old months ago adult shed relegated terracotta tile floor
loves amor
youre one wanted dog gloria murmured position bed voice thick sleep
know know
dont get
ill take little exercise manuel replied sarcastically
gloria ignored jab already drifting back dreamland
manuel slid slippers trundled across floor bathroom sadie locked side anticipation going walk
stood toilet going business sadie obediently waiting side threshold forbidden area yawned loudly stretching arms head finishing rubbing hand across coarse stubble cheeks
fat knew dangerously maybe forty fifty pounds
always lose daily mantra going half hearted morning jog inevitably terminated huge breakfast loaded cholesterol carbs cheese
manuel scratched bottom considered shaving decided hed forego chore today
entered huge walk closet donned workout outfit green america soccer tunic basketball shorts turning sadie whose eyes twinkled anticipation

asked innocently
sadie danced back forth tail whipping air frenzy everything power convey master indeed wanted
find someone wanted go walk
manuel exclaimed sadie began whining pranced doorway occasionally leaping air twirling completely around canine display balletic prowess
manuel decided give dog break torture although knew enjoyed buildup much enjoyed reaction
together moved bedroom door made way hall wholly unlikely pair
stopped kitchen greeted maria cook already simmering something heavenly smelling expansive viking stove top

machaca remarosa replied softly
maria sixty los mochis north culiacan sea cortez remarkably talented cook
shed quarter forty years still looked forward meals every day

manuel brutal killer executed twenty competitors two decades ascending cartel ladder sinaloa loved mother four children dog wife two mistresses
marias cooking
never occurred question lifestyle hed come streets hed started collector one aranas cells worked way current position one altamars trusted lieutenants making ten million dollars every year
boy slums terminated education age twelve live wits streets culiacan
cartel game made rich man wanted nothing
get hands dirty
hed murdered first man thirteen using bread knife never looked back
life relatively tranquil reign new boss hardly kill anyone far year anomaly business
time peace happy reaping rewards altamars rule
still remembered bad time years back miguel executed streets running red blood
hed pack family send lake chapala worst
months hed lived like terrorist commander hiding life different anonymous locations waged guerilla war competitors day
like anything else supposed
good times good times
wasnt perfect nobody got rich mexico without getting bloody
hed made choices prevailed
couldnt complain
manuel lumbered entry door sadie springing alongside stepped outside crisp air bright new morning
loved time day
cool enough werent sweating clothes rainy season hadnt started yet
spring perfect time live sinaloa relished season joy alcoholic full bottle
morning shift bodyguards dutifully waiting outside two terrain vehicles weapons cradled laps ready jog whatever time begin
hola chicos

manuel greeted men
no reply answered
none expected
werent friends no matter warm fuzzy acted understood role protect chat
sadie whined nudged hand nose anxious get underway
manuel began stretching using columns porch support smiling beloved dog barely puppy
searing lances white hot pain shot upper body chest exploded
blood splattered sadie men burst gunfire brush pounded torso
men froze momentarily taking cover wherever shooting haphazardly area gunfire come
two atvs gunned motors went tearing direction sniper first one others head exploded vehicles slowing turning aimlessly operators dead
two guards porch taken refuge behind heavy stone columns firing without conviction dense foliage propertys perimeter
manuel stared blearily complex herringbone pattern brickwork dome built roof porch cupula breath gurgling holes chest life ran onto rustic stone floor
sadie approached nosed face licking flecks blood chin effort comfort warm tongue last thing ever register
eyes met instant grew wide noisily exhaled long groaning rattle shuddering stillness
sadie lay beside master stood circled
nudged nose dogs done since time theyd joined humans companions caves sat pointed head heavens let forth baleful howl filled sadness pain world
beloved master gone
alone surviving
chapter mean altamar missing
fuck mean
missing
jorge encarlo screamed cell phone
mean decided disappear bang fifteen year old days mean hes mulch tomato field
jefe telling everything know
heard friend friend went missing yesterday organization scrambling find
doesnt sound like young love voice phone advised
encarlo bulldog man heavily muscled buzz cut closely cropped four day shadow
anything else
god damn get information
dont care
really big someones taken cocksucker encarlo snarled
know

know goes
nobodys going talk think wind beheaded
right
get
problem altamars taken need move rapidly well good dead encarlo warned
everything
really
give time ill find
came easy getting anyone crew talk
theyre chatty types remember
encarlo silently counted three
look
paying tell hard job
paying
fucking job get intelligence ill find someone
encarlo fuming nobody take anger
stared little motorola flip phone latest model snapped closed frustration
hell going altamar
really missing way suggested never reappearing except pieces floating river encarlo needed get positioned take action lieutenants
worked
king dead long live whoever left smoke cleared hosed blood sidewalks
didnt make rules survivor nonetheless
thirty one already reputed mover even cartel standards utterly ruthless
hed learned early shock awe went long way towards moving food chain prone violent outbursts slaughter slightest provocation
modus operandi served good stead
encarlo owned recycling plant shipped product united states processed provided excellent cover shipping items north well
operation one many responsible growing methamphetamine traffic slowly displacing crack cocaine many areas
booming market rock bottom production cost profits trafficking synthetic drug swelling accounts
made cocaine trade seem like small potatoes growth curve kept
picked unconsciously scabbed area left ear
nervous tick one many hed developed constant pressure stay one step ahead rest wolf pack
encarlo used products consumed fair amount meth cocaine cocktail stimulants enabled sleep four hours stint
firmly believed much success thanks long hours worked addition innate cunning born streets
traits combined relentless sadistic bent sociopathic streak envy serial killer made perfect mid level cartel functionary
men competitors terrified good reason chemical supplementation often resulted erratic mood swings set bloody tirade virtually anything
right antennae picking vibrations opportunity early news altamars mysterious disappearance
knew confirm man actually gone good hed perfectly positioned capitalize situation take rivals knew hit
got dangerous facts known lieutenants time thats became killing field one left standing
hed gone multiple times never guarantee make next one no matter much badass
idea creating loose coalition like altamar never entered head
look weaker competitors cooperation simply eliminate claim networks
outreach approach worked altamar encarlos opinion flawed plan weak man evidenced taken two years top little hub
needed know going needed know
anxiety building knew harsh experience something salient
anything
sitting waiting feedback reactive tastes
restless tapped line cocaine help focus quickly snorted using gold tube carried purpose
brushed little gums shook head clear
drug coursing system encarlo resolved see shake loose information
hed hit street see anything came back personal contacts
confidence men couldnt sit still wait
glancing watch noted already nine thirty morning
time move
stabbed keypad office phone barked orders calling car brought around
next dialed second command told get three men packing heavy heat meet vehicle five minutes
encarlo opened file cabinet retrieved glock 9mm pistol slipped windbreaker pocket
small gun packed decent wallop hated wear shoulder holster like undercover cop
hed tried ankle holster bothered easier carry thing pocket
encarlo made way downstairs ground level strode office doors past heavy industrial equipment yard toward truck silver fully loaded lincoln navigator custom rims steel armored plates welded four doors
three men joined toting variety submachine guns
didnt like screw around went town believed prepared assault times
wasnt much paranoia occupational hazard kept alive far
driver nodded climbed passenger seat three enforcers climbing behind
one reasons liked big suv enough room three grown men back
truck moved toward front gates opened via configuration hydraulic pistons activated security guard booth street exploded blossom orange fire
concussion plastique affixed gas tank shattered windows nearby buildings pieces truck spiraled mushroom cloud black smoke inevitably dropping like icarus back earth
nothing survived sort blast men came running slim hope salvaging anything
rey took several snapshots little camera across thoroughfare
put ford lobo gear pulled away road final destination day third target point already good neutralized
lushly green acreage around luis barragan inspired mansion hills outside culiacan still late morning doldrums absence breeze seasonal effect made outdoors swelter unpleasant even seasoned natives

five men closest counselors serious demeanors air thick cigarette smoke anxiety
hed gotten several frantic phone calls alerting explosion encarlos plant troubled implications
pilar sensed move made wasnt sure behind hed dispatched group armed men see information get network lower level cartel soldiers acted informal communication channel street
preliminary reports come back werent good
two four rivals departed earth morning violent circumstances
one explanation warranted swift decisive action
pilars nemesis valiente making play leadership position altamar held cartel underboss officially missing significant enough time
mean war pilar seasoned veteran countless purges fights
pilar educated attended university monterey held degree business administration served well creating managing network
hed studied taken heart lessons business school fancied superior ignorant thugs whod ascended equal footing sheer brutality barrel gun
understood place bloodshed liked think knee jerk reactions involving indiscriminate slaughter
no fool sensed time put diploma strap pistols
captain eduardo arguing passionately lieutenants nodding approval
chance
weve patient foolishness sit waiting war come
valiente offensive best chance avoid bloodbath make pre emptive strike
cut head snake body stops moving
pilar considered counsel nodded
agree eduardo
explosion killed encarlo combined news remarosas execution ominous
bad feeling think safe conclude valiente making major offensive mean next
like waltz start shooting solve problem
valiente far smart taken way
pilar pushed back table stood began pacing compulsively spoke
sympathize everyones passion argue misplaced
yes need act also need coherent plan
right bluster talk
lets finish discussion whether removing valiente good idea

want hear ideas pilar said gesturing bottle pelgrino emphasize point
men looked none daring advance idea shoot
heres going
want talk among think best eliminate valiente end day
put proposals table come something makes sense
dont waste time arguing something thats decided
need ideas passion
instinct says running time time get busy
pilar glanced watch sighed
commitments need attend
make no mistake valiente must die sun goes relying come achieve
pilar fixed man turn intense stare bristled quiet menace
may veneer civility education dangerous cornered pit viper men quick remember hed made top group
ill back shortly
make good use time
pilar strode room shaking head
classic turf battle needed get top valientes goons showed machine guns
wasnt afraid compound well equipped latest alarms electronic sensors advance warning devices enough firepower stop battalion
felt safe home confident attempt going made wouldnt happen
dense foliage extended miles created natural barrier one road
moment least safe
pilar thought valientes likely next step wasnt overly concerned frontal assault
vulnerable ways besides obvious
power struggle lasted long business negatively impacted cause disruption among lieutenants dangerous shooting war
bad enough pilars rivals homicidal psychopaths without worry younger junior aspirants throne cutting heart slept
moved pocket doors separated great room rear deck took beauty grounds
times extreme adversity defined leaders even though fancied civilized man understood necessary swift unequivocal response threat
pilar no problem killing went territory
hed always tried keep violence arms length always successful enabled maintain presumption superiority
something tree line caught sun pilar squinted make
hair arms bristled detected movement flash neurons brain ordering body drop floor high velocity partially jacketed round blew cheekbone apart taking better part cerebrum
time guards chance respond single shot perimeter shooter long since departed sound dirt bike hed pushed silently half mile noisy memory woods
mexico citys sky laden hulking dark clouds rey pulled hills infamously dangerous metropolitan traffic
toyota run like champ pleasure drive softening blows rutted patches culiacan distrito federal locals referred mexico city
hed gotten contact information man valiente new patron sponsor known since childhood
valiente made phone call proposed relationship friend couldnt possibly refuse
man owned pawn shop hed fallen leveraging contacts underworld facilitator extermination work human kind
difficult role basically good decent man money simply attractive turn no risk proposition
three contractors handled domestic disputes business disagreements took twenty percent contract price handle money vet clients
rey needed someone trustworthy launder money deal payments
going professionally needed front office speak professional representation
handle sourcing jobs couldnt haul around several million dollars hundreds effective
needed banker accountant
valientes contact seemed ideally suited role
valiente warned friend dealing lest get bright idea take reys money run hills
cartels vouched someone made introduction someone screwed person youd introduced expect held accountable recommendations actions
valiente seen enough reys handiwork short period know didnt want coming
narcotraficante chief become reys biggest admirer promised spread word prowess return commitment never accept contract
seemed reasonable rey valiente comer powerful cartel planet sponsors go worse
plan limit activity hits year steadily increase fee charged well level difficulty sanctions accepted became highest paid killer world
mexico right place given amount money flowing cartels although hed heard good things russia
problem didnt speak language
hed studied english school course spanish

wouldnt work petersburg vladivostok
merged toward right lane took ramp clogged freeway even congested area city
circling around half hour eventually located pawn shop managed find parking spot
threw black duffel bag shoulder made way two blocks store
neighborhood sketchy even mexico city standards saying lot money lenders last resort didnt tend located ritziest areas
glass door shop noted bars everywhere providing security night incursions well roll metal awning completely seal storefront
bars seemed like overkill rey liked hinted man took precautions engineered
careful man needed
establishment modest measure suggested lack braggadocio hubris
strongly positive reys position
pushed open entry door walked small somewhat shabby showroom inexpensive glass cases showcasing tarnished treasures impoverished downtrodden
silver infant cups cheap watches scarred gold chains obsolete cameras
rey liking guys style
last place world expect find man handled affairs high end contract killers
nothing shop spoke money success high rolling usually hand hand cartel related businesses
said boring
rey liked boring
approached barred window fabricated inch thick bullet proof glass pushed button next listening buzzer echoed rear behind heavy steel door right

someone scrubbed every surface right got entire town far see wandering around downtown area like
took cab airport hotel blocks sydney harbor stowed gear locking cash hotel room safe unpacking hygiene kit
hours sleep get adjusted seven hour time difference set explore town hed understand layout
four minute walk ferry terminal circular quay quickly convinced town filled tourists one mexico wouldnt stick one fears
never wanted memorable anywhere went no problem judging host accents languages heard moved along waterfront quaint shopping area called rocks toward opera house
rey approached iconic theater sat point waters edge aggressive shape unmistakable almost every photo postcard hed seen
kept walking towards ocean soon found verdant well groomed park passed young lovers reposing grass stealing moments together school
weather equivalent late autumn australia seasons reversed northern hemisphere still relatively mild sunnier hed expected
clean
used mexico sydney shock system aseptic
even made way park area supposedly seedier nice best neighborhoods back home
stopped long pier sign front announced finger wharf looked hotel built harbor sydney felt immediately comfortable dimly lit soothing minimalistic contemporary lobby
deserted save young woman working behind desk based ambience solitary location decided right hed moving following day
walking away harbor explored area inland hotel
quickly degraded run industrial district warehouses alongside shabby lower income housing
buildings looked though undergo renovation much area desolate found person streets mid afternoon weekday
made mental note perfect mind
hed begun outlines rough plan plane purely conceptual everything panned work well
another hour meandering streets adjacent waterfront made way back hotel hailed cab asked driver drop two streets away address chilango lived
drove upscale area fifteen minutes city center cab stopped front small market block harbor
neighborhood eclectic exhibiting hodgepodge architectural styles coexisting dissonant manner
everything elegant multi story turn century victorian mansions post modern contemporary found
certainly prosperous area judging cars trim houses
rey knew waterfront homes anywhere world always expensive figured australia no different
bought bottle water bored shopkeeper strolled towards targets address relieved find sidewalks empty
reached junction dead ended target street deliberately avoided chilangos house preferring make left street ran along waterfront homes rather right

rey told man town used valientes name way entre
arranged meet hour later caf immediately front ferry terminal
victor wearing orange shirt blue windbreaker tan cargo pants
rey watched vantage point across busy common man dressed described entered caf sat window
five minutes scanning quay ensure no surveillance rey strolled took seat opposite
victor mid forties rail thin heavily lined sun damaged face boasting perennial flush habitual hard drinker spectacularly crooked teeth thatches salt pepper hair pointing directions
looked like nothing much absentminded professor boozing problem
gday mate

following day victor made arrangements cabin cruiser pick rey pier marina hosted hotel adjacent condominiums restaurants
checked current hotel walked taking waterfront room week third floor

thirty eight foot riviera sports fisherman twin diesel engines soon cutting chop fair clip
rey gave captain gps coordinates portion harbor wanted anchor fish
man looked though crazy
wont catch much muck suckers mate advised
thats okay
like water enjoying scenery looking beautiful houses rey explained
motored designated spot dropped anchor
captain dutifully got two light tackle salt water fishing rods bag frozen bait
rey played along allowed man drop line water went inside salon heavily tinted windows blocked anyone seeing
raised binoculars scanned house noting neighbors homes searching anything afford advantage
paid special attention shore area distances homes wasnt much
fortunately chilango built tall walls either side security privacy wouldnt deal neighbor issues inside
sat bobbing wake boats cruising past noted three security men nosing around one report led believe
either house received sort warning surveillance sloppy
instead day man night one six total three three
spent two hours anchor boat rocking gently rey mainly watching house
lunchtime hed seen enough
target visible several times living room bedroom cinch take single shot
unfortunately wasnt paid
reconciling unpleasant reality hed hard way announced captain time leave
one two rods screamed line tore reel skipper ran tighten drag
set hook offered pole rey shook head no interest trying fight fish

evening rey phone discussion victor arranged meeting next day look industrial space hed gotten inventory hardware
morning blue ford sedan pulled curb original hotel rey stayed
victor grinned behind wheel inviting get
soon motoring deserted area near turns arrived bleak strip old industrial warehouses
victor got opened one heavy steel doors stepped dilapidated twenty forty brick space reeked stale air urine
rey tried lights two fluorescent bulbs flickered struggling stay lit flash suddenly illuminated
assassin studied shabby interior arms crossed nodded

glancing around dank room final time rey dictated additional list items hed need based surveillance target appraisal new workspace
victor scribbled furiously small notebook rey ticked requirements
finished eyed overhead steel beams supported roof rey made two requests
victor nodded assured within forty eight hours space outfitted went car removed long duffle requested hardware brought inside space
rey inspected item carefully nodded approval
perhaps victor resembled buffoon hed gotten everything right first try

hoped victor well second round stuff
none specialized confident man able get
three days later returned warehouse
completely transformed
rey impressed
hed spent parts last days targets neighborhood driving around victor studying layout watcher confirm number guards night well
chilango rarely left house whatever wine business apparently run home
make things somewhat harder far easier stage something target transit played cards dealt rey confident
tomorrow show time either justify considerable money hed spending course antipodean vacation die trying
chapter stiff gusts wind blew tall oak trees near waters edge occasionally eliciting moaning lament airs harmonic passage branches
partially cloudy night sliver moon peeking overcast
lights surrounding homes harbor twinkled danced roiling surface water reflected moving time swell harbor mouth surged outcropping shore point piper upscale neighborhood called nub land thrusting water creating double bay one side rose bay
three tough looking guards prowled grounds targets home two stationed front back one circulating around
lot security relatively modest home safe area
neighbors wonder occupant
men best appear discreet obviously trained killers military bearings tell tale bulges handguns windbreaker jackets
easiest duty ever
endless hours nothing guarding nobody imagined threats never materialized
theyd gotten complacent nine months theyd working gig understandable given uneventful nature job
made man happy money spend liked werent going complain
fifteen thousand american dollars month apiece theyd put trapeze performance ride unicycles tightrope every evening thats patron wanted
quiet one weeknight cars winding way along new south head road tracked coastline
sydneys suburbs asleep citizenry enjoying well deserved rest privileged enclave
small black inflatable dinghy moved towards shore slicing small swells made silent way night
hundred yards point operator dropped anchor water cutting little electric motor
sat rising falling waves getting sense amplitude acclimating
waterside targets home glimmered luminescent green night vision scope
rey easily make sentry sitting rear deck smoking cigarette reading book
unprofessional given biggest threat security team thought likely encounter enraged koala eucalyptus fueled rampage appreciate lackadaisical attitude
last mistake ever made
still understandable
crosshairs modified assault rifles night scope bounced waves weapon made ungainly additional weight long flash suppressing silencer affixed barrels end
surface movement decrease likely accuracy hed spent hours rural area town sighting victor yesterday exactly required distance margin error acceptable variance two inches
additional factor brisk breeze automatically made mental adjustment
blowing harbor mouth toward point back shouldnt huge effect
hed spent prior morning loading twenty shells special blend powerful charge compensate velocity difference silencer introduced proved worthwhile sighting
higher powered payload attenuated distortion introduced device
hed flattened tips slug little carved top filling indentations solder filing no danger jam
nothing ruin well planned assault like faultily loading weapon hed spent hours task taking gun putting paces
watched roaming sentry approached seated guard presumably ask cigarette seated man reached breast pocket offered one pack
rey regarded two sentries scope taking care close eyes seated man lit others smoke
wouldnt ruin night vision matchs flare
pair chatted lazily rear stone patio darkened house rey gently squeezed trigger
standing man crumpled next seated guard chest exploding outward onto stunned partner fragmented slug torn back shards exiting front along chunks pulmonary system heart
rey caressed trigger gently lover might receptive lips mate seated mans throat blew onto heavy stucco houses rear faade
left guard front getting little apprehensive within minutes roaming man didnt return appointed rounds
rey waited patiently inevitable rewarded seven minutes sight third sentry rounding corner house
another well placed shot took draw weapon
assassin checked watch smiled ten minutes threat security force neutralized
watched grisly tableau moments ensure nobody moving placed rifle bottom boat shrugging scuba harness
double checked waterproof bag cell phone two pistols propelling backwards dull splash cold water bay
took three minutes swim distance pulled onto shallow beach front house paused unclasp tank remove scuba rig dropping stood sand along flippers
like boat recovered later night victors clean men wasnt worried leaving traces
padded neoprene dive booties grass separated patio beach extracted silenced beretta 92fs pistol bag
quickly gliding corpses lay put muffled slug mans head purely professional diligence
nothing disruptive well planned operation wounded man gun exhibiting second wind heroics
niggling housekeeping chores concluded rey studied locking mechanism rear pocket doors fishing foot long stainless steel strip looked much like ruler fact albeit modified jagged hook ground one end
slid carefully center section abrupt pull opened lock
back bag went fished second pistol odd looking gas powered gun fired horse tranquilizer dart
house blueprints victor sourced building department still fresh mind stealthily ascended stairs knew master bedroom located
neoprene soles booties made steps silent fortunate product unfashionable outfit
drew nearer partially opened master bedroom door ears pricked listening tell tale warning signs
satisfied house still pushed door open rewarded creak hinges corroded salt air
figure bed stirred sound lunged dresser
rey fired dart gun left handed dart missed scant inches embedded pillow
target swung around silenced pistol began firing even rey made split second judgment call charged rather shooting
ignored white hot stab pain lanced upper leg hurled air prone firing chilango within heartbeat dislodged gun grappling left hand dart slammed beretta butt mans head right
struggle matter seconds former cartel boss slumped mattress darts soporific venom stabbed side neck found way bloodstream
rey lay still top target moments assessing throbbing pain thigh
felt blood seeping wound wasnt spurting meant projectile hadnt hit artery
still bad pain significant
looking around room rose limped master closet flicked light
eyes scanned rows neatly hanging clothes alighted bathrobe sash cinching waist
pulled fabric strip loose pulled drawers open found white cotton undershirts folded neat little parcels
grabbed one tied place using sash studying makeshift bandage acerbic satisfaction
get medical attention
returned dark bedroom reached waterproof bag dangling dive belt retrieve cell phone
peering targets inert form bed pressed speed dial number
victors voice answered

no worries rey answered ubiquitous manner hed heard used countless times locals since arrival
gimping bed lifted chilango arms dragged roughly hall stairs
man cold two hours knew awoke head feel like someone hammered board wasnt far truth given gashes pistol left blood already coagulating crusting streamed face
ground floor slid inert body front entrance foyer watched side window vehicle
twenty seconds later saw outline pull
swung door open greeted sight victor trotting black delivery van theyd arranged evenings festivities
took hard look rey standing doorway blood oozing shirt affixed leg wordlessly went chilango began dragging back van
rey limped helped get target back climbed

next secret hidden cave chapter key
suddenly clear key missys back pocket wasnt ordinary key
rock ledge jessica wide enough several people still high enough make stomachs jittery wasnt ordinary ledge either

grabbed indentations deep enough provide handhold
left hand seemed good hold right hand scraped dislodged key
instinct made grab fell forever lost
jessica gasped look missy
missy losing balance even though door no longer pushing outward upward
loud mechanical grumble underbrush well hoarse voice definitely human rasping gotcha

strange feeling knew way home

step lightly miss gwinn said tall red haired man passed pretty young woman
step lightly zerd responded
tommy frowned greetings wondering happened traditional good morning good afternoon
neither two people headed way
miss gwinn went right toward two story building zerd went left toward pen holding several pink sheep
least tommy thought sheep sounds making sounded less like bleating like meowing
interesting place tommy thought noticed two people coming behind building
heard greetings lowered voices spoke whispers
one pointed toward tommys hideout two looked quickly
miss gwinn went inside building telling friends step lightly goodbye
aware maybe step open thought decided
turned headed back hill took path opposite direction
wound around several blue trees forest blue
several rocks littering path every one stepped soft springy
began bouncing way along rock rock
suddenly voice stopped cold
step lightly young man

unwrapped stick rolled ball putting mouth
crumpled wrapper tossed away
suddenly loud roar huge lion like creature appeared behind large marn
head typical lions mane body fat pig like curly short tail

tommy stood frozen spot beast sniffed gum wrapper intermittently roared
maybe penalty littering doldale death
tommy finally got feeling back legs started run back way come
roars lion behind grew fainter tommy dared glance back see followed
group marns ahead looked like boulders
breathing heavily getting stitch side ached
slowed pace headed toward marns intending sit one rest
comfortable sitting large marn
quite soft noticed sweet scent wafting upwards
wasnt hungry imagine taking nap one soft creatures
heard burbly sound smelled aroma
breathed deeply
smelled like nothing particular everything general grandmas garden moms perfume dads cologne apple pie fresh cookies flowers meadow cinnamon pancakes
making stomach growl eyes grew heavy
scent drugging put head next marn stretched
odd yet comfortable bed second marn began softly burble well
aromas arose hot chocolate fudge popcorn roses tangerines

mouth fell open gum slipped
slept hard

old womans face window smiling

went around tree found way back path
marns slept puffed back original size something different
tree growing
hadnt
curiously tommy felt bark ran hand trunk
reached put weight branch
thing happen quickly
time screwed
leaves incredible new tree blue every growing thing
looked branches see pink rectangles scattered throughout
looked like sticks gum
tommy remembered chewing gum fell asleep marns
tree grown one piece chewed
jumped threw leg limb nimbly climbing new tree
reached stick gum smelled plunging mouth
yup
gum right flavor chewing
maybe drop coins thought start bank
dropped ground started left fork
tommy gone far thought gone expected encounter lion moment
started tiptoe case beast sleeping pass unnoticed
saw
sleeping fact snoring loudly shade new blue paper tree
paper looked like gum wrappers
almost made sense gum tree gum wrapper tree lion
visitor left create monster
stuffed animal
kept creeping following path stepping lightly around smallest marns chewing gum thinking wondering
happen next
chapter marn rocks crysta lins path ended abruptly wall rock
no going left right around mammoth rock without leaving safety path
boulder sized marns everywhere didnt dare step
climb look around
couldnt parent marn tommy hoped started climb
hard scratchy odd suddenly show blocking path
found another foothold heaved higher onto ledge
looked back blue landscape thought fuzzy things distance seemed
maybe needed glasses squinting lot blackboard last year
climbed straight came flat top somewhat spongy walk
reached pressed fingers rock
soft small marns stepped first arrived strange land
rock began vibrate tommy lost balance
tumbled forward rock perhaps mother marn started roll path
first leaped started walking upright stay top realized marn gathering speed going direction come
quickly scrambled forward backside
hard going escalator back mall
kicked landed thud path right first blocked giant marn marn behind
tommy hurried along stepping lightly course glancing back time time sure angry rock wasnt rolling way crush
two blue coins jingle jangled pocket kept rhythm speed
smaller marns way seemed spaced way hop skip patterns
became game got better faster paying attention anything around trail
peal thunder clapped loudly nearby followed three bangs
tommy watched lightning cloud sky
strangely sky turning normal blue sunset greens
shades green none usual sunset colors
thought crashing sound assumed thunder
replayed mind reminded grandfather clock wasnt supposed run past
four dongs close together must quarter something
path sloping downwards going easier fewer fewer marns avoid
green sunset spread like picture see outline cityscape beneath bottom shades green
path veering right soon disappear forest blue
tommy hesitant enter darkening woods since no better option continued
forest immediately enveloped sights sounds also strange smells
bad smells skunky smells burnt rubber smells ashtray smells
sounds better songbirds owls
sights strange
tree twisted grew unexpected directions
sometimes crawl climb limbs way trail
skunky smell pursued seemed grow stronger nostrils thought burst stink
breathed mouth found taste stench
chewing gum faster didnt help
trail grew narrower harder follow trees
ahead saw flock small birds darting tree tree singing madly
owl flew straight nipped ear
burst threw tangled branches blue spruce scattered songbirds
tommy stunned find path split two sets forks
sign two right paths said luruss steps
sign two left paths said doldale steps
wasnt hard decision tommy chose far left path doldale
one thousand nine hundred seventy nine steps maybe get
dark blue forest behind green sunset front knew hurry make dark
spit gum started counting steps loud running little half jogging
single marn get way kept eyes path looking something bopped head
stopped short hit behind
suspended golden threads large diamond shaped crystals floating air head front across trail
small silver sign side path warned latest phenomenon
beware crysta lins
breathe heavy stay doldale
tommy pondered message
obviously beautiful objects crysta lins since sign said beware might dangerous poisonous something
felt forehead first one smacked
wasnt bleeding bump itched
back head also sported lump scratched around spot
felt like giant mosquito bites
sign mean
breathe heavy
blew first crysta lin withered eyes
heard pathetic cry instantly felt sorry
beautiful object puddled feet melted
two much larger crysta lins blocked way
pushed aside hands moved forward steps
hands began itch dreadfully
crysta lins sizes beautiful sparkly hovered around
no choice breathe heavily one watching drop disintegrate sadly ground
continued way quite light headed huffing puffing feared pass reached doldale
lost track number steps taken surely thousand city seemed twice close
elated abruptly no crysta lins block way however gate closed path progress
pay toll visitor
screamed childlike man behind gate
pay toll
much
two blue coins tommy obediently answered
man looked harmless enough
doldale luruss
demanded
tommy didnt slightest idea

removed another torch stood staring empty wooden torch holder half expecting another torch magically appear
nothing happened
burning torch hand made circuit glancing back empty holder time time keep perspective
instead examining four walls found five walls time room much larger though still no door no window no hole no escape
tommy decided made mistake first time
dungeon couldnt grown
glanced back toward empty torch holder another flaming torch burning

wondered big make place
set two torches middle area ran wall wall collecting pitching flaming sticks center

robots pulled laser pistols aimed vinnie
hence obvious solution real source victory vinnie mumbled
robots fired vinnie ducked
laser blasts sailed harmlessly head robots ended shooting chest

robots stood moment circuits sputtering shorting falling large heavy clunking sound
vinnie kept mumbling walked ackers nancy johnny

johnny smiled
dad always said johnny never helped dishes quite frankly never get done
dad tended forget things like
johnny picked backpack headed door
good day father son said time thanks also unison
johnny headed door
room draped shadows light coming entire wall regular monitors
side multiple holographic workstations displayed air hidden projectors around room
sense royalty room
carpet rich red large expensive paintings hidden darkness walls
people scrambling room work different work stations conversing low voices
set stairs led large chair shaped like throne widow black sat watched worker bees buzz activity
throne numerous small holographic keypads widow efficiently enter commands change work flow many people around
scar entered dimly lit room making sure keep wide berth around many people room
made way across rich carpet toward stairs lead throne
one workers got close scar couldnt help snarling keep distance
worker looked impassive face went business
faces unnerved scar concluded
none workers muscular control faces
locked neutral expression couldnt move mouths part head besides neck eyes
always turning looking impassively things gave scar creeps like nothing else world
course reason workers like androids built accomplishing tasks looking realistic
another one got close scar stared
pointless gesture doomed failure android couldnt even blink eyes even facial muscular control no eye lids
get way
scar said last shoving android aside continuing way throne
android fell clang
androids noticing companion fallen immediately stopped turned lidless eyes scar
one one left work fell line behind closing movements hemming toward throne
scar continued walk began become aware happening stealing glances corner eye
big strong didnt like prospect fight army androids
surely widow black call got far line
wasnt calling
turned smile dangerous gleam eye
scar continued walk toward throne androids continued close
already completely cut way back
mattered scar never ran anything ever
held head high walked right stand widow black
androids moved like zombies reaching grasping hands toward scar slow methodical precision
tensed bent slightly low ground prepared onslaught
might take wasnt going go without fight take many
might even lash opportunity presented
scar understand failure tolerated lost valuable artifact
thing place
even fight back died probably expect no less
scar widow black stared unsaid understanding hanging like serpent ready strike scar press button
broke eye contact looked finger poised holopad button bring life back androids sure death
moment thought pressed button thought saw finger move corresponding light emit holographic display beneath hand
nothing happened realized eyes played trick
feel getting jittery waiting becoming much
going let already
part cruelty part fear instilled others
widow black understood anticipation almost always worse punishment best make much part punishment become
scar forced look back meet cold hard gaze
slowly moved hand away holopad controlled androids
scar judged distance throne
wanted try charge got hand back near activation button
widow black stood throne took step toward scar frozen army androids around
scars breath caught throat
well away command controls nothing time got
strong incredibly strong
no doubt probably overpower
continued walk toward malice evident eyes
throne well behind
widow black walked almost casually brimming anger
delivering message didnt need androids take care
also invitation let try attack felt dared
hesitated unsure
physical power one thing no real idea capable didnt know tricks hiding
fact really didnt know anything
thing scar felt knew sure attacked failed end
staring cold dark eyes scar wondered already late
widow black lifted arm struck across face back hand
scar stumbled take balancing step keep falling
hit hard scar reassess thought strength
taste blood mouth
willing risk fight
scar straightened met gaze
moment subdued wasnt going challenge authority power
didnt say anything looked
message clear widow black dangerous woman far dangerous anyone ever realized
scar valued life lesson well remember
ackers going kill
main thought kept racing johnnys mind sat class
kept trying push thought kept coming back
realistically ackers lecture brain away melted pile unrecognizable goo
probably one worst forms torture ackers particularly good
thanks technology anywhere anytime
johnny realized thinking tried push mind
brought attention back class
sniders walked around room menacing stare
wearing another one loud polka dot dresses johnny couldnt understand someone wear ugly clothes made stand high degree almost dots varied colors specifically made clash much possible
sniders looked way
johnny best act like paying attention
remembered foul breath didnt want anything call attention bring nearer
already bad enough detention didnt want anything make worse
finally attention wandered students johnny free stop pretending
glanced nancys empty desk
hadnt come school day johnny couldnt help thinking something gone terribly wrong

second thought going johnnys mind competing ackers wanting kill
looked time hour late
johnny started wonder something bad happened
obviously concerned johnny chose go school delivering super chip department
nancy ackers agreed point two joining sides lecture beginning look like crazy nightmare come true
going try take chip house school
johnny couldnt believe
knew working short time trusted enough believe never try anything like
gone along without qualms handing chip got
wouldnt handler whoever want
johnny beginning worry
clunker
johnny shook thoughts see sniders entire class looking
day dreaming
sniders continued
johnny bent low notebook pretended write something
no listening said somewhat pathetically
johnnys mind racing
last thing wanted sniders come close make smell horrid breath
suppose like enlighten answer
sniders asked
great thought johnny never gave break
dont know answer admitted breaking eye contact staring floor
sniders gave exaggerated sigh
seems make habit wasting time
fortunate spending detention time perhaps find way get one track mind right track
sniders went english lesson
johnny shook head going long day
ackers stood outside johnnys front door
looked nervous took frequent quick glances around see anyone watching
preposterous no one knew
ackers tried stop looking place focus task hand compartmentalize step follow goal
glanced next objective getting past front door
likelihood no one home
johnny
fast school dad gone work
lack car driveway confirmed
ackers gave moment pat back acute observational skills
next step bypassing locked door
ackers reached hand tried turn door handle didnt move
definitely locked
course ackers couldnt take granted
things investigated instead assumed knew sure door locked knew exactly proceed
checked driveway make sure car still gone
ackers gave loud sigh stalling knew
glanced around street quickly see anyone saw sigh think place
berated acting foolish amateurish
tried turn handle sure
still locked still no car driveway
enough time get business
ackers took backpack shoulders put ground
zipping open dug series gadgets food rations looking particular device
found brought looked like large thermometer handles
line blue instead red liquid trapped inside see tube
ackers carefully inserted device crack door squeezed looked like blue mercury tube device door
kept squeezing no blue liquid device
got back waited watching stream smoke came door
applied enough liquid bypass locks structural integrity matter moments allowing bend like rubber open door lock returns solid state ackers thought loud
thinking realized presence behind
froze
couldnt believe definitely someone standing behind porch
caught already
happen
united order wasnt supposed know real identities let alone johnny lived
perhaps ackers slipped security somewhere
even possible
ackers slowly turned around see paper delivery boy standing porch mouth hanging open surprise
ackers immediately sprang action using nothing words try confuse misdirect potential assassin

ackers said
boy held paper answer mouth still open looked weird gadget sticking front door
yes thank looking ackers said took paper paper boys hands dropped ground
youre little late arent
isnt supposed delivered first thing morning
morning certainly first thing ackers rambled trying get sort information paper boy confusing time
boy continued stare gadget
ackers sneaking suspicion wasnt assassin
relieved almost fainted right
immediately proud
look well handled situation
course boy nothing civilian really wasnt much situation handle ackers relieved think things
locked house
dont worry situation resolve moment ackers said thinking quickly appear normal possible arouse much suspicion paper boy call authorities
ackers gave front door small push
bolt lock bent like rubber allowed door swing open house
see
back house problem concern ackers said biggest uncomfortable looking smile
almost looked like ackers straining facial muscles spread lips far enough across face
ackers rarely smiled entirely possible muscles atrophied lack use
face started twitching effort keeping lips spread wide enough hold smile
paper boy became slightly alarmed longer stayed ackers
started taking steps back porch
high pitched sound coming somewhere inside house
ackers turned away paper boy peered house
sound
alarm
ackers yelled paper boy soon figured
likely giving thirty second delay enter proper code let computer alarm monitoring station know returned home house live
ackers simply no good thought splendid job putting paper boy ease
anything paper boy probably less alarmed stumbled upon group people wearing masks trying openly burglarize house
paper boy took stumbling step back another ended almost tripping tumbling stairs
ackers turned attention back alarm
stepped inside house went back outside pick paper delivered thermometer gadget used open door
dont want forget ackers held paper called
paper boy hurried away
satisfied done best appear like lived house ackers went back inside slammed door behind
approached alarm keypad emitting noise inspected distance
reached backpack pulled square box keypad front
placed box alarm keypad completely covering started entering random number combinations keypad
worked methodically trying different sorts numbers different orders observing display box typed
soon display told three four numbers correct
ackers didnt much time left alarm go
got fourth number
almost find right order
perfection
job done high pitched noise stopped
ackers slumped wall exhausted
no wonder stayed back base anyone supposed think clearly field distractions
got good look combination numbers used turn alarm
four three two one
kind code
might well left door open
ackers detached keypad box threw lock picking gadget backpack
inside next step finding super chip
found super chip
ackers held hand staring awe
small harmless looking thing yet ackers knew whoever held chip power circumvent worlds technological safeguards
like ultimate skeleton key able open lock
around ackers johnnys room complete mess
ackers turned every moveable item lift dumped contents floor tossed johnnys clothes closet even taken apart johnnys old computer made sure chip wasnt hidden anywhere prehistoric machine
ackers finally found buried bottom closet
knew instantly super chip no hiding amount connections registers chip held ackers ray glasses
ackers took glasses continued stare chip
tear started welling eye one beautiful things ever stared
art perfection ultimate ackers stopped unrestrained admiration
noise
ackers listened intently
someone opening window johnnys room
looking wildly around room ackers spotted place instantly hide
dove desk old computer held breath daring move muscle give chip away
must protect costs safety world depended
well course protect well
world wouldnt want get seriously hurt injured incapacitated way saving
ackers swallowed large lump throat
outside field work really wasnt meant someone important
nancy pried window open dropped lightly johnnys room
looked around disgust unable believe johnny messy appeared
brought hand started keying entry small computer strapped onto wrist
wrist computer started emitting series beeps like sonar
nancy walked around room listening beeps get faster approached different pieces technology
went around room listening series beeps deciding refine search
old computer desk one area alarm clock johnnys bed oddly enough something ceiling attracting devices attention
decided start desk
walked old computer listening beeps got quicker louder
underneath desk ackers frozen wide eyed fear
couldnt see snuck window knew technological radar heard one
listened beeps came closer caught
nancy walked forward holding wrist computer ahead beeps reached frantic pitch
something powerful somewhere around desk
large explosion downstairs rocked house
nancy lost footing grab desk steady
heard sound booted feet running carpet
someone yelling orders
nancy going abort mission compromised
keyed series commands computer turning beeping headed back window
quick look outside told no one covering side house least hoped wasnt
case didnt much else left try escape
nancy dove window
ackers clutched heart fear try stop beating chest
explosion come
going
authorized
no answers questions ackers forced take kind action wait desk caught someone
first order business find room without caught
cautiously spy like ackers peeked desk looked around room
no one sight whoever gone
window still open no trace anyone
ackers heard sound furniture breaking glass shattering downstairs
clearly two different groups breaking steal chip nothing
least clear get without seen either
brought next order business find dealing best deal
words although ackers never admitted way find best get away whoever house
ackers crept door opened crack trying look hallway signs intruders
upstairs completely empty looked like still downstairs
opened door walked quietly banister
ackers looked downstairs
flurry ordered chaos
soldiers destroying everything sight find super chip
barely getting way smashed shot every hiding place find
even walls werent safe blasted laser guns searched holes trace technological wonder ackers clutched tightly hand
opened fist looked simple looking thing
defend knew
risk life put chip using every gadget skill disposal save precious artifact
words probably going die
heroes died defending believed
ackers closed fist tightly resolve strengthened
soldiers turned attention toward stairs leading
ackers shrank back shadows sight
perhaps heroes find way avoid dying still defending beliefs
maybe hiding best thing ackers moment
resolve quickly fading ackers turned bolted back johnnys room softly closing door behind
think something fast going upstairs moment
ackers glanced toward window thought throwing chip outside
wouldnt problem anymore maybe find maybe wouldnt
one thing sure definitely going find kept
no admonished couldnt think like
protect couldnt give
world counting no surrender no throwing away responsibility
like one situation going right thing
ackers held super chip looking resting gently palm
minute going break door ackers thing think
opened mouth wide swallowed super chip
like lump throat moment got stuck ackers choked
fell knees face went red
chip safely stomach
moment ackers hoped stomach acids wouldnt destroy
cursed thinking sooner nothing
ackers struggled back feet faced door
hear soldiers side
time run ackers knew
nothing wait caught
least wouldnt surrender chip couldnt
no matter happened no giving
ackers tried steady nerves breathing kept head high
ready face fate true hero end
nancy watched attack johnnys house safe distance away
partially hidden behind large oak tree much like one zip lined night johnny walked home failed attempt get chip
multiple vans parked sporadically street front johnnys house back doors still wide open army soldiers poured
several still guard around vans keeping watch around neighborhood signs resistance
nancy shook head
like full scale invasion
shown bit earlier probably enough time find chip leave anyone got
nancy brought small device clipped ear
activated two quick taps waited connection established
nice day barely cloud sky
wasnt hot cold perfect weather
youd never know anything bad happening peaceful sunny day
united order got chip back day none ever forget
united order never make mistake letting steal chip back second time
moved super secure location guarded best people technology order afford
use get whatever wanted
build wealth quickly power increase fast
soon people stand soon no one defy openly
unstoppable force upon world
nancy heard series beeps told link established several layers advanced encryptions making almost impossible anyone listen conversation
voice spoke end line said one word yes
voice modulated scrambled making pointless try figure person end line
anyone able break security connection even wouldnt find anything worth knowing
wasnt able retrieve chip
united order showed two dozen soldiers tearing house apart find nancy said continued watch house
end line handler stayed silent
nancy waited knowing handler didnt like interrupted given bad news
nancys handler meant world
handler found two years ago helped train shown make use advanced technological gadgets world ever seen
given enough time nancy probably turn toaster jetpack laser gun radar scrambler
handler also taught fight handle crowds people one one expert martial arts masters
handler given new life away cold foster family orphanage
also given nancy spy name seventy seven identity sense purpose went along
nancy didnt entire organization behind like johnny ackers

chapter still look ways cross street even though nothing left look
no longer running cars left wreck world old habits still remain
child father take firmly hand pause curb
stop ask cars coming
dutifully crane neck peer whatever road
given clear hastily cross street rogue vehicle strike
cars rare arent watch arent left
fuel spare parts long since disappeared
roads crumbling weed choked rubble foot traffic horses rare caravan making use ancients proud achievement
fathers days trail always busy carrying goods
times memory
traders rare number goods scavenged crumbling ruins diminished considerably
everything easy take taken
since no one skill make glorious objects matter time reduced digging dirt sustenance
mere parasites dying world waiting end come
entering paused outside looked home twenty eight years
one hotels left trading trail
like large buildings town ewark made ancients
made hotel different stood three stories high days rarity
anything else taller crumbled away decay becoming yet another ruin scavenged building materials
nonetheless brown brick outside walls repaired many times hardly resembled building remembered childhood
back looked new day made
large parts exterior patched roughly mud no proper bricks left make repairs
father mother cried see looked like
town ewark nothing prominent buildings surrounded number smaller residences made inferior materials
besides hotel mosque calls pray emanated town hall local sharif named faisi ruled open market nothing much left sell general store often empty shelves
desert lived bad farming residents raised half starved livestock made living providing services traveling caravans
days past good living recently decline business
part preferred move north town ever known wanted know
said northern climate cooler cities prosperous
every day someone left city make trek
still hadnt decided
near entrance hotel line nine tethered horses stood hitching post
snorted drank wooden watering trough tails brushing away ever present flies
two soldiers mujadeen resting lazily shaft spears watching horses disinterest
little see town even less unless knew right men
one men find entertainment jaded customer
brothel though woman little interest place wager throwing dice even bar
course places like forbidden holy laws ruled entire world vices always around man no
one soldiers saw
grinned saw small barrel balanced top shoulder
said know landlord possession alcohol strictly forbidden
confiscate unless like lose head
changing expression stopped bowed deeply hard barrel resting shoulder
natural strength task unmanageable
fresh water master lied
fact beer bought friend kalam lived nearby
brewer trade sold select number clientele
product well known upper classes area visiting dignitary want partake
soldier laughed knowingly round belly shaking dirty tunic made roughly knitted wool
spat willing sample called water master
wouldnt want poisoned fall sick
afraid said pushed past
no reason talk two also little reason anger
common soldiers mujadeen underpaid lot least security knowing next meal coming
beer possession cost man life sub vizier staying hotel beyond petty rules
men knew imbibed forbidden liquid everyone given chance
locally one black market sellers beer allowed barely enough coin keep place running
compared heat outside lobby hotel cool haven blazing sun
carpeting underneath feet quite threadbare oak panels dire need repair building still managed cling long forgotten charm older era
placed wall aged grandfather clock broken years ago hands permanently stuck ten minutes five
also paintings faded photographs showing unknown scenes past building people streets crowded cars
loved repair interior former glory like bricks outside no carpenter truly master techniques ancients
hussen recently hired clerk looked impassively front desk passed
man medium build shock black hair always looked unruly brown eyes forever roaming hunting prey
missed old worker pawl recommended cousin take many duties
really no reason complain new mans performance sullen show respect thought deserved
least read write say many residents shrinking town
taking creaky wooden stairs two time climbed third story
took hallway leading best room
dark light coming open window end hall
suppertime candles lit guide customers rooms economy forced rely natural light day
stopped door near end hallway
giving tentative knock door immediately opened thin sergeant wispy black beard
dark eyes looked perhaps checking weapons
important visitor precautions taken
landlord finally arrived said
flung door open let pass
mentioned best room hotel
really two rooms time past combined one
original wall separated two rooms graceful arch ended white column either side
open windows revealed seemingly unending desert outside
two sofas sprawled soldiers busily eating lunch lamb stew maid brought
messy eaters rightfully feared condition fabric worn amazing condition considering age
side room sat sub vizier rasid
resting low chair feet propped edge bed
rasid large perhaps obese man entire region
seems rest working hard stay alive afford luxury large dinner
sherwani jacket turban made finest golden colored silk pants made whitest cotton
richest afford garments since paying rare workmanship prohibitively expensive anyone else
peeking sash wrapped around rotund stomach see butt ceremonial pistol
secret gun lost ever since time ancients
powerful mujadeen power get rare required ammunition
soldiers rest made due swords spears bows
amazing small device kill scores men leaving user free exertion
mikel
rasid boomed
beamed black pointed beard bobbing anticipation beer resting shoulder
glad see
come bring good drink
graciously bowed ingratiating manner since rasid valued customer mine
though visits rare big spender helping provide enough income help keep afloat bare years
drew near black eyes glittered rolls fat made face
years batch turned well
asked licking lips
certainly sir answered
wish tap barrel may sample
nodded watched greedily rested barrel table spiked open
cellar stored beer splashed cold bottom hand
poured golden liquid long tall glass already placed readiness sub viziers visit
smacking lips anticipation rasid took glass hand drank deeply
moment looked glass flecks foam upper lip
said allah correct
best batch yet
someday meet maker fine drink
pour mug men come replenish mine
shall sit talk since much discuss
bid pouring mug beer man
though alcohol forbidden law seem mind
returned rasid refilled empty glass
motioned sit edge bed
rasid leaned squeezed knee sour smell breath hitting nostrils
smiled wanly
tell mikel business
fair replied
rasid squeezed knee one time returning interest back glass beer
took another gulp
trade appear getting better
warlord worried rebels may effect caravans
think
knew rasid reported directly warlord
whatever sub vizier said also interest faraway ruler
shrugged
years trade getting steadily worse
see getting better especially since traders no longer loot ancients cities like
time goes common objects luxury goods get expensive
hurt
stared
think rebels consequence
shook head
never seen one ewark
true
seemed rebellion small little consequence
sometimes men talked mostly humor
commonly thought mujadeen used easy scapegoat
rasids free hand waved across points compass
rebels everywhere
travel roads looking easy prey
magnificent power mujadeen civilization
agree
course agree said bowing head supplication
mujadeen also keeps safe creatures wasteland
fact mujadeen power ever since evil days ancients destroyed
no one imagine world without warlord followers
made laws also enforced iron fist
said warlord governed city washtin mighty army command
simply crush rebels matter speculation
wasnt mujadeen no law
no order world
rebels want
speak freedom no one afford
speak liberty offer nothing chaos
old words mean nothing anymore
kind world promises bring
simple hotel owner replied slowly shaking head
know little politics even less ancient words rebels speak
course speaking truth
though visiting traders spoke rebels no one ever claimed robbed
personally put little stock called rebels since never seen evidence hold countryside
people feared wasteland man
rasid meanwhile laughed fat jowls face shaking mirth
friend succeed regime
care business dont
stability good business answered meekly
good business good
took another sip beer expression hard read
need talk
warlord worried rebels starting gain prominence area
evident enough towns
worries supported populace especially since trade diminishing
hungry bellies soon means land ripe revolution
hungry people willing listen far fetched promises no one possible keep
need people like eyes ears stop rebellion spreading ewark
frowned
sure mean
run business caters travelers
certainly must hear many rumor men stay establishment
pass information great help
attach much importance position said humbly
eyes narrowed becoming near invisible slits
voice became suddenly harsh said think
isnt exactly request
order
say else consequences
command replied quietly
chapter next morning watched sub vizier men rode away
glad see go since like man give orders especially inside hotel
still decline demands since business run
take one word rasid thrown home even put death
unfairness irked no end way world
nothing commanded
days passed summer heat became almost unbearable
like oven inside rooms except blowing sands world outside became still
travelers decided leave visit kalam home
cellar brewed beer kept precious liquid stored away beating rays sun
kalam much older old friend father
actual age unknown rumor great warrior captain mujadeen
pressed information never say thing instead shake head smile
took business death father kalam continued sell illicit alcohol without word
seemed like well enough quiet way
watched kalam carefully measuring hops dark wrinkled hands gently moving cup burlap bag pail
turban covered head held low eyes concentrating task
think ever seen lose single one
gray beard cascaded chin covering front simple cotton shirt
always relaxing watch craftsman work coolness stone floor relief boiling heat outside
kalam man words surprised finally spoke
gravelly voice always low almost incoherent except closest friends
croaked ive heard rasid sub vizier came visit
bought beer mentioned since seem care consumed
trusted enough keep name dealings law
expected without comment since father done
yes replied uncertainly
nodded hair beard bobbing
want
replied cautiously stops hotel least year
part tour province make sure well
nothing unusual
rasid ask anything special
no favors
began wonder asked questions since kalam never shown interest business
voice sharpened replied care
kalam shrugged
no importance
curious
slightly mollified answered spoke rebels growing influence
asked report rumors anything ordinary came way
actually order really
something seems bothering mujadeen
feel
told spy others
like replied honestly
job run hotel spy customers
kalam returned attention back work
said shoulder times changing
old order crumbling like bricks hotel
careful want stay alive
mean
asked
shrugged answer
angrily left kalam letting old man keep mysterious words
entered town
days ewark certainly impressive sight said mighty metropolis days ancients
back supposedly innumerable buildings built dizzying heights network roads mysteriously lit night thousands residents
looking rutted track ran handful low buildings past stories creation fanciful imagination
nothing sand
underneath surface scraps old wreckage occasionally discovered someone digging well repairing foundation
still great city disappeared sands
returning hotel decided replenish larder
store stopped built scant twenty years ago already looked collapse
hardened mud made sides faded years blowing sand thatch roof sagged one side
really good place except open market owner luxury monopoly trade
pushed open wooden door let clang bell mounted frame
inside saw customer
dingy usual two oil lamps providing light except sun shone dimly dusty window
glass counter stretched length store equally dirty cuts meat inside swarming lazy fat flies one reason preferred buy meat local farmer
rest food supplies sadly purchase
mikel
voice rang behind counter
myliss storeowner
skinny shrew woman lank brown hair streaked gray
manner towards always ingratiating heard sharp tongue employees less wealthy customers
good morning said
shall need fifty pounds rice ten pounds butter five loaves bread
also need saffron ginger garlic
sadly shook head
everything butter garlic
give twenty pounds rice
hesitated answering calculating state supplies
going make things difficult
trouble vendors
regular supply caravan late
one week
going start raising prices things get better
shrugged since caravans usually notoriously late
well deliver
make already last little longer
number customers visiting hotel little chance starve death
need payment myliss said normally friendly tone hard unyielding
also need payment last month bill
always pay time replied indignantly
changing terms many years business
expression cold unyielding
asking mikel everyone
get food prices going rise
means costs also going rise
need money pay suppliers make ewark
really bad
grumbled
well return money hand
face softened revealing underlining anxiety
way things going wonder business next year complained
deliveries getting rarer rarer
caravans make complain robbery theft even death
pondered news
always dangerous caravans things never stopped degree
sorry hear myliss
no one complained sharif
job keep province open trade
shook head
made several appeals always tells lacks manpower cover every route
anyways much happens beyond borders province
ive heard word creatures wasteland march
dont take much stock fantasies
theres nothing sand unless believe childish stories
wasteland massive empty desert west
went innumerable miles rumored populated terrible beasts
traders steered clear area roads heading north south still touched borders accursed place
mujadeen supposed patrol areas keeping citizens safe violence
bow left store wondering fresh information meant
chapter summer reaching zenith
days long dusty hot
afternoon front desk hussen going accounts
pencil scratched busily paper read pitiful amounts
recent visit sub vizier enriched pockets business poor
hotel currently unoccupied probably stay way next weeks
rate close months
enough business keep solvent
price food higher ever since everything livestock dependent trade
handful caravans made leaving city practically starving
no one knew happened missing wagons making mysterious
dire thoughts cut short opening front door
walked swarthy man dressed dusty tunic grimy pants black leather boots seen better days
travel worn turban wrapped around head partially undone loose cloth knotted across face protect ever present dust scorching sun
gray eyes stared keenly
room available
asked quiet dignified voice
think might able fit lied manners practiced hotelkeeper
happier rent entire floor
hussen staring dumbly stranger
normally cruel man hussen attitude way bringing worst
fool finally moved kicked squarely rear
get guests bags
shouted
hussen scuttled outside giving malignant glare left
visitor smiled scene modern employee management
said calmly like room northern exposure one lies ground floor
room available
yes arranged
wise choice say
side hotel much cooler time year
please sign register
studied register book moment untying cloth face exposing short cropped beard narrow cheeks
prefer sign
really necessary
looked guest closer wondering balked signing
perhaps enough money stay
law replied firmly hoping scare away potential dodging payment
smiled fine lines around mouth growing prominence
lets say private disposition
willing pay keep privacy
shook head
law everyone must sign ledger else fined
reaching tunic guest reluctantly retrieved leather purse
opened pulling stack gold dinars placed desk
enough pay silence said
abuse trust
lean times no man refuse sight gold
nodding grabbed stack coins pulled towards
moment hussen returned two leather cases hanging arms
eyes followed money disappeared pocket
looked suspiciously back forth stranger
take guest room twelve commanded
yes sir
hussen replied sourly
shuffled new guest tow
called stranger sir dinner served promptly six oclock
tonight chicken rice
come left devices
mysterious guest respond instead disappeared hall
left wondering trying remain concealed
easy enough write false name since wouldnt bothered examine traveling papers
anyways local sharif never came around check register
mystery one going concern
really no reason pry mans affairs
suddenly remembered words sub vizier
interested hear man trying travel roads without leaving trace behind
contact rasid
expect go sharif
gave no instructions situation
merely asked rumors stories passed way point potential troublemakers police
thought salved conscience somewhat
probably nothing report since traders liked remain anonymous fear robbed
pushed thoughts aside returned book keeping
happy small stack gold received since allow stay open little longer planned
perhaps heat reduced autumn travelers take roads
faint hope one
bad wasnt anyone left ewark afford buy business
really want travel cooler north leave everything behind since home ever known
later day finished chores kitchen helping maid molli prepare dinner
see rice bubbling nicely stove oven came delicious smell chicken
stole glance molli looking lovely ever
family almost twenty years started age nine
made little older
still retained much beauty ever present sun turned fair skin nut brown

supped salam began tell story one quite familiar since heard countless times
course everyone since part history sort tale passed father son mother daughter
loud commanding voice salii said countless years ago back oldest grandfather even child age mankind lived sin
people earth creatures beholden outlandish fashions strange addictions life without guidance mohammed allah
immoralities great war came
war ravaged globe destroying life cleansing land flame famine
battle soldiers fought cities burned green pastures turned desert people many lands hunted destroyed
even though playing tai salii stood ancient frame wavering
raised hands voice rising volume
ashes rose mujadeen free sin
might sword took left
mujadeen turned chaos order reshaped world better place
blessed threw sinners made place safe free worst natures
guidance one god
chapter small bedroom located room behind front desk
handy arrival late night guests
kept personal treasures small painting parents original still sealed pack cigarettes times ancients collection antique drinking glasses
perhaps nature business ive always poor sleeper
nonetheless even handicap hear tai leave night
must left window room since hear passing doors lobby
time middle night awoken sound gentle tapping
feeling disorientated opened eyes met pitch blackness shuttered room
sound coming single window looked road yards away
fearing enterprising thief trying gain access inside reached side table retrieved dagger normally hung waist
never cause use ornament expected dangerous days
darkness stole gently window
fling open noise suddenly stopped
opening window quietly possible swung back shutters
light moon see no one standing outside

slowly shook head
even motion took considerable energy accomplish
no doctors
no one must know
well doctor town isnt good fear life receive aid

went desk put dagger
quickly gathered pen scrap paper
brought tai began writing earnestly short cribbed letters
hands shook
amazed strength finish
tai done handed note
closed eyes let long sigh died without word
stood shaking head disbelief
getting wrapped something want part
slowly opened note found read
written unknown language using unfamiliar characters
perhaps coded manner kalam read
thoughts interrupted someone pounding front door
took note tucked fold sleeve
leaving bedroom went lobby listened
sounds coming outside sounded mob trying batter way
since no way treat home angrily strode jerked open door
soon pile five mujadeen soldiers came crashing giving little time dodge
good evening voice said
say good morning
rasid
standing door looking amused clumsiness men
nothing amusing pistol held hand
pointed straight
dark opening barrel reminded blackness death
one twitch finger finished
wondered rasid
thought left city
come said weakly
sub vizier strode imperiously lobby sergeant
interest followed
hussen
grinned malevolently previous meekness replaced arrogance never encountered
second thought emotion always barely concealed behind clever mask
sergeant rasid commanded want place searched top bottom
tear place apart rebel spy found
spoke gun hand never wavered
looking
demanded soldiers scattered look hotel
rasid hussen sergeant remained
rasid spat know looking
hes guest
gave hotel damaged

pointed door behind front desk
afraid wont use

hussen snarled
dead replied simply hoping put end matter
sergeant go take look
sub vizier commanded
waited silence sergeant went behind desk bedroom
hussen glared black eyes filled hate
perhaps wanted vengeance past actions
rasids expression remained unfathomable
sergeant returned quickly shaking head
said
rebel dead
man shot rasid said coldly
supposed taken alive
never get information
shrug sergeant said allahs
troubles cast aside heard molli scream
discovered kitchen
pray remain unharmed
knowing manners soldiers doubted
fears soon realized dragged kicking fighting lobby
soldiers gathered around loose circle eyes shiny anticipation
stomach felt sick knowing going happen next
helpless stop proceedings unless wanted shot unwavering pistol rasids hand
knows nothing protested words fell deaf ears
rasid going let men fun
way paying back working far night
started shoving molli around making fall ground picked repeat process
nightgown quickly torn open exposing skin underneath
sight seemed inflame soldiers lust even
soon blood running knees hair wildly disarrayed
sobbing entreaties went ignored
stop
yelled
rasid made motion hand
assault upon molli immediately stopped
fell ground nearly senseless pain shock huddle like wounded animal
said mikel become involved rebels
thought friend
involved protested
provided room tai

gave little laugh
no reason believe
weve looking cell town
little know hotel
perfect place
rebels come go without noticed mixing travelers
hussen said perhaps mikel tell rebels know project
project

asked wondering hell talking
rasid stared expression hard calculating
well hussen proceed questioning
make sure kill right away
warlord displeased ferret everything knows
sergeant grabbed arms tried hold
hussen took chance struck hard face
content let situation go hoping realize really nothing rebels
rasid appeared worried head
kill meant saving life
ever since small boy warned keep temper check always quick anger
self control kept violent emotions bay
let go
vision receded red haze
felt skin crawl rage
even rasids pistol trained didnt care
going die let said died honor
easily shook free skinny sergeant swinging around struck head fist
went sprawling wall mighty bone splintering crash
traitor hussen grabbed neck squeezed
eyes went wide shock
swung bodily front desk
ancient wood cracked body hit frightful impact
fell ground scream agony
turning attention rasid saw moved
face remained impassive infernal gun still pointing
took step towards hands stretched grab thick throat
no one beat bullet said sneer
caring took another step
flick wrist rasid fired
tried hopelessly dodge
bullet hummed ear striking wall next
another step hissed
dont want kill
least yet
still answer questions
anything else blow struck back head
entire world began spin vision began fade
another blow knees
ill never know hit ended saving life
couldnt rush rasid take blasted gun away
consciousness faded away felt body go limp hit floor
seemed like second
heat intense
body ached worse head
felt sliding across floor like sack potatoes
every ounce faded strength opened eyes
took moment realize surrounded fire
smoke thick grey
closed eyes wondering descended hell
panic opened eyes pulled head floor see pulling
energy nearly made pass
saw kalam expression grim
swam darkness world became nothing
chapter awoke find shivering cold
rag draped forehead frigid water dripping hairline
body knot pain
sickening lurch remembered everything recently happened
felt numb wondering happened molli
lying side blinked open eyes saw lit oil lamp next
along walls tidily stacked wooden barrels beer
immediately recognized kalam cellar
kalam
croaked

heard reply side room
whiskered face soon close mine
stared concern

asked whisper
shook head
sorry

perhaps tai stayed thought dangerous
ever became connected lost everything took many years build
cover traveler apparently suffice
still weak managed snarl bastard hussen saw
molli

hesitated speaking
eyes betrayed regret
afraid molli dead
felt stab grief deeper expected
perhaps loved cared admit
kalam continued entered hotel saw stabbed heart
found badly beaten
miracle still alive
hotel set fire left inside burn
rasid men rode thinking going die blaze
managed get rescue succumbed flames
hotel gone
asked feeling sick stomach
sorry

dull throb anger mixed sorrow beat slowly heart

asked loud expecting real answer
old way life forever gone
said afraid stay much longer

felt chest tighten anger
asked sarcastically safety matter

shrugged dismissing accusation

kalam lifted hand quell protest
said worry going set free wander countryside found alive dead
first must take minute rest gain back strength
must leave travel across wasteland since place safe mujadeen
wasteland

wasteland goes forever hits sea
shook head
wasteland mountain range protects rebels
free men continue fight mujadeen

kalam smiled weakly

shocked information somehow believed
kalam never lied

no choice
shall keep fighting destroyed warlord minions evicted land
no choice win
dont understand say
sighed
time coming mujadeen
time men land free
back ancients built society greater ever come
like things made man survive test time
men grew weak society crumbled like dust faction fighting faction
everything failed land destroyed great war
men left disaster resist hordes first warlord
remaining free men pushed wasteland almost perished
eventually found safety mountains learned survive
hard existence stronger
soon ready make move mujadeen
new information coming fast
finally asked tell tai

kalams eyes lit memory
wonderful place completely unlike desert
imagine towering rocks pine trees streams cool green grass
long time since home place dream
certainly like get
chapter horse given old brown haired nag seen better days
least gait across desert smooth helped pain bruised battered body
except drum hoof canteen clattering belt held sword quiet
bags rolled blanket bow hanging behind cinched uncomfortably close saddle
freely admit no horseman since rarely needed rely service living ewark
also no warrior
never need weapons depend brute strength handle trouble
setting moon full making strange long shadows desert land
cast glance shoulder eastern horizon still see glow burning hotel
never left home
felt wrong leave ewark fools errand choice
stayed eventually discovered killed mujadeen
flee north city feared rasids reach long
no safety
kalam given horse water bedroll enough food see next days
coded note tai hidden inside inner pocket jacket
kalam also given directions rebel town along roughly drawn map
according instructions go around lake supri enter wasteland
traveling find entrance low rocky valley river flowed
valley pointed mountains rebels like long dagger
matter traveling valley mountains beyond
journey seemed easy enough provided mutans let pass
advice received kalam dealing mutans simple direct
see mutan run hide since strong taste flesh man
no reasoning dont stop try
traveling horse able make valley one night mutans abide world without sun
best stay city ruins since numerous
stay close southern wall trail
safe enough provided use wits
mutans creatures legend sort nightmare used scare little children
never seen one many stories travelers stayed hotel told ferocious manlike creature killed pleasure
traders dared explore depths wasteland never seen
chance
shook head thought wondering fate put dire position
no choice make best
rode another hour sound desert unbroken except passing
thought molli unfair died
also thought mother father disappointed
doomed live poverty squalor misunderstanding mujadeen
still wanted no part called rebellion cursed kalam involving
refused room tai
passing thoughts broken neigh horse
leaned petted neck trying quiet old girl
perhaps sensed danger
looked ahead saw nothing
however sense ease quickly disappeared heard behind galloping unknown number horses
everyone knew mujadeen patrolled area protect denizens wasteland
caught soldiers surely questions answer
kicked flank mare bolted ahead
really no idea long horse last since nothing old nag
surprise speed considerable took whatever limited skills stay back
hands held tightly bridle aching thighs stayed cinched around sides heaving flanks
rode way deserted plain along no idea close pursuers
afraid turn look since lost balance
ahead make long dark shadow stretched length horizon
lake supri
better going end caught
suddenly limited light moon saw arrow fly strike sand ahead
without even thinking turned head look pursuers
barealy stayed mount
hundred yards away least dozen men horseback steeds pressed forward chase
horror mujadeen soldiers quickly gaining stirring streaming trail dust went
leaning forward kicked hard flanks poor horse
responded another burst speed tell old girl beginning tire sure footing becoming clumsy breathing ragged exhaustion
wasnt going last much longer rate
behind sun starting rise
night heading roughly southwest hoping strike edge lake
right front
hundred yards away
beyond body water lifeless wasteland
horse stumbled slowed canter
another arrow sped past followed another half dozen
missed plowed sand ahead
looked shoulder found pursuers speed also slackened
fifty yards behind surprise looking another horseman galloping towards right
man dressed long black robe riding equally black horse
hands waving air motioning soldiers stop
surprise pursuers slowed pace
hit edge lake sun shimmering still blue water
another glance showed mujadeen soldiers stopped
one talking robed stranger others watched rode waters edge
let horse slow walk along pebble strewn shoreline
continued glance soldiers wondering press attack
horse tired continue forced stop dismount
keeping wary eye pursuers let mare drink lake
lather old rag began wipe
soldiers wheeled mounts around began slowly riding away
rider black stared momentarily features indistinct distance following others
mystified behavior since still within bow range
didnt strike chance
let horse rest
continued drink lake ate yellow grass growing along shoreline
sat slumped sand watching small waves water
rising sun beat shoulders
afraid say fell asleep
pain shock night much
no energy left continue
chapter awoke find sun blazing overheard scorching sand around without mercy
position tell time mid afternoon
face felt red raw exposure
throat also aching thirst took long drink canteen
chided foolishly falling asleep since lost valuable traveling time
mare near shore lake head drooping drowsily
body ached got see
gently rubbed nose
whinnied appreciation rocking head back forth
youre good horse said soothingly
alive
filled canteen lake
pulled onto mare gently prodded forward easy pace
perch saddle finally see wasteland detail
though first looked like desert different minute ways
unlike land traversed no life single bird flew sky ground free occasional lizard snake
also free vegetation without single cactus joshua tree seen
rode along found wasteland also deathly quiet wind horse breaking oppressive silence
felt entered graveyard
even heat baking sun shivered unknown fear
nightmare stories place suddenly become real
shaking bad feeling pulled map kalam provided
looks head north west hit opening valley
headed far north miss entrance together run walls valley strayed far west lost desert
sadly compass sun
kalam warned dangerous descend valley using walls find entrance
sides valley steep treacherous made impassable horse man alike
traveling across length desert also impossible since enough water carried supply man horse
fresh water somewhere deep valley route take
rode time sun slowly dropped west burning bright eyes
night came northern star became navigation
already rested day continued chill night
living desert long immunized rapid temperature difference night day still wished brought along something warmer wear
leftover heat sun dissipated sand ended using wool blanket cover head body
riding silence desert unsettling experience
beyond sound horse hooves striking sand squeak saddle nothing
felt like sailor lost sea alone forgotten rest world
unchanging rhythm noise started lull sleep causing eyes droop weariness
soon found sleeping several times moment unconsciousness broken head slumping forward hitting mane horse
tired continue finally slid horse fell heap cool desert floor
went sleep
feeling something warm nuzzle ear awoke start
mare brown eyes looking mine
sun high turning ground furnace
getting drank water sharing meager resource horse
quick breakfast jerked meat saddle looking signs valley entrance
know caused look shoulder perhaps nature wasteland made one cautious shimmering waves desert floor thought saw dark figure riding behind
looked like stranger stopped soldiers pursuing
pulling reins halted mare take better look man
time see anything since distortion heat across sand made everything look like waving black ocean
still shake thought followed
however rode along checked shoulder never saw figure appear
hours later noticed black smudge horizon ahead slightly left intended direction
continued recognized blackness smoke rolling high sky
something large burning
started ride way
perhaps loneliness idle curiosity foolishly decided investigate cause fire
better minded business
expanse smoke grew larger stride mare
came closer source slowed walk
no reason incautious wasteland since mutan trap unnatural phenomenon
ridge ahead smoke billowing behind
along ridge several footprints indentations sand large group laid wait
dismounted mare cautiously made way across burning sand
upon closer inspection footprints oddly shaped
certainly looked like no animal ever seen
much like foot man narrow
toes also left long scratches sand indicating sort claw
disturbing sight soon forgotten looked ridge
line dozen burning wagons
voluminous cargo space looked like sort wagons used traders
no signs owners even horses pulled
goods inside scattered across desert floor
gulped nervously tingle fear crawled spine
looked mutans attacked caravan happened people horses
decided best move discovered
ran horse practically leaped onto saddle
grabbing bridle kicked flanks went gallop
looking behind saw nothing warrant haste feeling fear still stayed
really expecting much poor beast grudgingly decided slow canter
right saw little gully dipped desert floor
since no signs tracks decided take way precaution remain unseen potential observer
feeling smug decision ridden ten feet gully suddenly front sand exploded
no chance react knew hidden net lifted ground
wrapped mare immobilizing movement forward
horse neighed terror started kick buck
mesh net covering face panic beginning rise
rolled side freeing saddle stirrups
falling open side net find lying face gulley bottom free trap sprung
jumped feet eyes greeted horde vicious creatures rushing
everything moving quickly
little time examine mutan features wicked black blades enough decide next move
tug unfamiliar sword ripped scabbard hanging belt
clumsily swung blade closest beast splitting misshapen skull two
blood came black night
killing nothing stop mutans continuing attack
swung another blade struck home never saw killed foul creature overwhelmed sheer numbers
anything else tripped soon covered mass bodies
fetid stench worse ewark trash pit
still fought trying leverage strength superior numbers
nothing soon blow head stopped struggle
passed
chapter pain filled haze awoke start wishing head stop used receiving end everyones frustrations
wrists hurt hands felt numb
peeled eyes open sticky sweat sand find looking fire blackened skull close face
eyeless sockets stared accusingly guilty predicament
sick smell burnt breakfast thick air
felt bile rise throat
looking blurrily around surroundings found tied rusty metal pole arms hanging head
pit contained nothing ashes
craning neck left right saw pit twenty feet long five tall poles like mine
pole remnant something human burned scraps bone flesh
stomach recoiled revulsion realized people eaten foot
struggled bonds without effect
finally looked saw three mutans sitting sand front pit
chance study extra detail little help quaking heart
hideous creatures coarse hairless grey skin black eyes malformed faces almost looked human grotesque extreme noses slits mouths lipless revealing rows pointed yellow teeth
short stature like boy twelve summers
no clothing except roughly made belt hold sword quiver arrows
short bows lying sand
wondered perversion allahs allowed evil things exist
mutans talking garbled language stopped notice struggles
barking laughs got approached pit swords drawn
one stepped closer mouth spreading wicked smile nothing wall rotted teeth
flick wrist blade tucked chin
feel sharp tip jabbing windpipe
croaked protest careful move
blade dug deeper allowing trickle blood escape mercifully dropped
let gasp relief
please pleaded dont kill
cackled appeals
ringleader goaded cruel laughter time sword sliced tunic flesh underneath
gritting teeth felt hot blood began drip chest past stomach
head beat hard pain swimming red color
mutan thankfully pulled sword away
breathed hard rivulets sweat dripped forehead
stop screamed
brought laughter tormenters
instead using sword mutan front began motioning hands
pain wracked vision appeared miming making fire
suddenly dawned aimed cook like poor victims caravan
shook head fearing dreadful pain fire licking feet legs
knew hurt worse anything ever experienced
one mutans dug ground behind
large basket soon uncovered revealing coal like substance
help friends began ferrying contents pit legs
nothing watch scream fearing moment set fire
even though no one help began praying allahs divine intervention
no one came
tinderbox produced
scrapes flint later mutan cheery blaze going scrap wood
sheltering tiny flame hand walked pit set black fuel fire
looking see little fire spread
minute heat already heating booted feet uncomfortable degree
delight mutan started screaming time swearing tormenters
flames quickly spread heating feet legs hot piercing tongue pain ran length body
began moan cry agony
tears welled eyes blurriness saw one mutans suddenly collapse ground clutching neck frightful shout
fighting intolerable pain managed open eyes look
another one immediately fell arrow sticking bare back
remaining creature ran bow late
arrow struck leg causing mutan fall ground unworldly cry
saw shut eyes scream pain caused licking flames
able open eyes saw lithe figure standing wounded mutan
girl
took knife neatly cut creatures throat
help
called let another scream pain
suddenly intensity fire began abate
opening eyes saw standing front kicking burning coal side pit
even pain induced fog saw pretty thing short cropped hair narrow cheekbones thin girl like body flawless ebony skin
clothing simple tunic pair pants almost color sand
soon felt bonds part fell forward ground
heat sand felt cool face compared burning fire experienced
need water said bluntly
voice rougher beauty no mood debate merits either
turning saw bending face expressionless
eyes blue sky

asked ragged breaths needing know name savior
name suvan replied simply
mikel gasped
without word took water skin belt handed
shaking hands removed stopper took drink warm leathery water
felt wonderful
think walk
asked casting glance shoulder
know
feet hurt badly
little sympathy voice replied
better try
much longer friends come back
want happens
horse said
easier ride
shook head
afraid already dead
mutan hate horses even men kill sight
come weve wasted enough time talk
time move
helped ground grip surprisingly strong thin body
soon stumbling alongside step bringing new wave pain
already felt dizzy exhaustion wondered much longer go
saw taking well trodden path already heavy tracks mutan
going way
asked irritably
going run whole pack foul creatures
sighed exasperation
went straight across fresh part desert tracks obvious
way confuse followers
clever admitted
know much ways
talk much replied impatiently
stay quiet safe
much answer questions
soon reached flat rocky outcropping turned path
suvan stepped onto stony surface motioning follow
hard surface rock much feet compared softness sand
every step pure agony
suvan reached end stony surface dropped back desert floor
jolt pain making grunt
shady surface rock sat thankfully taking weight feet
take boots suvan gently grabbed shoulder
said know hurts wait little longer
want wait darkness comes move
better remain prepared
wouldnt want run mutan bare feet
youre full wisdom retorted harshly
exactly
ignoring sharp words said choose live
no choice matter
suddenly feeling foolish childish outburst said
still looking edge rock presumably checking remained hidden potential pursuers
suddenly dropped haunches sat next
kept voice low started tell story
father named aseik well known scout traders
use crumbling maps found many lost cities earning fee merchants
dangerous work since visit uncivilized parts far safety mujadeen guarded roads
turn traders took risk scavenging cities valuables contained within
number new cities discovered dwindled zero

traders still looking new sources wealth hoping large cache refill coffers
father came wasteland

nodded

chapter suvan taking lead traveled night
walked sand careful confident manner using stars guide
setting sun temperature dropped making wish lost provisions blanket
feet still bothering pain dull instead relentless throb
suvan prospects surviving journey looking better
stroke luck hoped meant better days coming
arent worried running mutan
asked whisper came crest dune
snorted
afraid dark
return camp huddle around fires like little children
perhaps see well night
course plenty dangers beyond mutans
best always stay toes
like sort dangers
asked
mutans bad enough
darkness make shrug
something strange land something alien forbidding
breeds evil
valley ive seen plants eat flesh
also seen unholy creatures inhabit darkest corners ruined city
ive traveled many lands father years never seen anything like accursed place
neither
hours walking dark menacing clouds began blanketing sky
sight suvan motioned stop
began digging big sweeping motions sand bare hands
come help demanded

making place rest day
need stay sun also remain undiscovered mutan scouts
like go rain coming prefer stay dry
also need take boots tend burns become infected
direction dug pit two feet deep approximately length height
knapsack brought sand colored tarp stretched hole
four long stakes driven corners keeping tarp flat desert floor
started rain water coming heavy drops
suvan crawled carrying pack
come rain take boots said voice muffled sand tarp
shrug slid inside
dark
taking boots busy fidgeting something knapsack
suddenly spark little flame flickered stub candle
said rain good since cover tracks
sit back let take look feet
requested feeling self conscious attention
yank sent pain shooting legs suvan slid socks pulled back pant legs
let low whistle

asked
replied concern feet legs terribly blistered
much right

stomach audibly grumbled
suvan laughed dug knapsack
said handing small thin strips jerked meat
started eating found taste rather different

asked bites
many animals live desert
lizard killed day
made face belly didnt care
finished small meal took swig water skin
suvan put lamp
shut eyes tried sleep aware young woman lying next
rain outside increased intensity drowning noise
rolling side put back hoping feel uncomfortable sharing tight space total stranger
surprise draped arm around waist
hand soon found way shirt fingers began playfully rubbing stomach
pleasant sensation still felt acutely uncomfortable
turning face whispered thought said needed get sleep
kissed gently lips making pull back inches
ive lonely whispered back huskily
hard turn obvious invitation
understand replied softly kissing back
lips cool remote
tell many women
replied kind question time like
due proximity feel shrink back
ive never anyone

tremble started shoulders went length body
put arms around suvan
resist
said gently years ago woman meant lot
thinking poor molli
shes dead
no others
old replied
teenager parents died unknown disease ravaged town
death forced take family business
isnt much time dallying local maidens youre busy running hotel
well show know
voice quavering nervousness
even though exhausted events day proceeded make love
inexperienced fumbling quickly became confident
entered wrapped arms around neck gently moaning ear
tight confines pit dug made interesting positions stop satiated
done fell asleep wrapped arms
smiled surprised recent turn events
stayed hiding place rest night next day
rain disappeared allowing scorching sun return fury
spent time eating sleeping exploring others bodies
wasnt sun set suvan broke camp started guide entrance valley
chapter night
hours hard traveling came entrance valley
moonlight see ground gradually sloping downward ending opening two massive stone slabs
compared open space desert looked like trap
felt nervous
swallowed hard trying force lump throat
suvan handed water skin
sorry offer anything said regretfully
hefted weight water hand
survive without
shrugged motion blur darkness night
water back little camp spare bow sword
afraid unprotected mutans numerous monsters reside within valley
figure something said bravely
grabbed arm squeezed tightly
please dont go
return camp
ill take somewhere away reach mujadeen
together
shook head
mujadeen control everything wasteland mountains beyond
get want continue live
even run another town always danger mujadeen recognize
hand dropped arm
said coldly stream valley look
mutan mostly stay together larger ruins dangers must worry
stay close cliff walls dont anything foolish
knowing say bent gently kissed cheek
respond instead pulled back
said haltingly thanks saving life
suvan turned started walk away
said shoulder go hell
respond took run soon disappeared shadow nearby dune
moment stood
ready face unknowns city yet
anyways already missed suvan
though known short time liked forwardness beauty
wondered ever see
stomach grumbled reminding must find food soon
heavy heart started walking slope entrance valley
sand see deep paths cut treading numerous mutan feet
wondered kalam rebels made since mutan seemed everywhere
still made journey least gave hope survival
valley floor flat progressed walls rose higher higher sky
suddenly stopped amazed saw
sides several large black alien creatures slowly inching across stony surface valley sides
distance darkness make details thought new creeping horror unsettled whatever calm
walked ground began widen
feet partially covered sand road built ancients
broken pot holed still recognized uniform construction direction
shoulders ancient street curious mounds rather large size
approached one cautiously found lumps made hollowed metal rusted dirty
wondered purpose served
perhaps used storage understand placed close road
dawned cars vehicle ancients father told
days practically gone since fuel keep running long disappeared
wondered running vehicles inside city
amazing find thing drive
interest cars disappeared soon saw ruin ahead
wasnt much building realization something watching within
full fear cautiously approached destroyed building half expecting mob mutans pour shattered doors
however anxiety unfounded since nothing left ancient walls twisted metal
remains gloomy interior see nothing wreckage whatever building held
thick layer sand covered floor
sign flaking red paint written letters coded note carrying
gave food thought perhaps learn secret language
continued dark road cars buildings started become numerous
awe ancients
civilization built much destroy
seemed impossible knowledge power disappear leaving dust rusted remnants
anything proved folly mankind aspirations
everything build loved someday gone
dark thoughts interrupted noise left
faint sound metal grating metal
another building
roof collapsed ages ago leaving nothing jumbled wreck rusting steel broken concrete
however foundation still intact black empty square indicating window stood
suspecting mutan activity silently crept direction building
left road boots began kicking dirt covered glass shards remnants windows destroyed building
even though valley far sparse vegetation noticed ground around ruin completely devoid plants
impulsively stopped feeling unsure
something definitely wrong place
around right ankle sudden squeeze violent pull
react fell onto back knocking air lungs
heart raced panic realized slowly dragged along ground towards foundation building
looking saw pulled something looked like thick black rope wrapped tightly around ankle
pressure hard feel foot going numb
reached tried unloop rope around ankle
touched rope shuddered disgust scaly unnatural warmth
realized alive
unknown monster trying pull inside ruin
kicked struggled still break grip
wished sword
left foot began pushing tentacle grip increased intensity
healing burns sudden burst pain caused scream
left foot hit something solid
foundation building
hole length tentacle disappeared inside
smell strong stench rotten flesh
bracing free foot concrete foundation pushed strength whatever terrible creature trying devour
locked knee strength tentacle redoubled
gritted teeth fighting keep getting drawn inside
grip ankle momentarily loosened
thought moment win inhuman strength hope vanished another tentacle emerged hole
watched horror second appendage ran along edge foundation almost like searching whatever impeding entry creatures lair
moment ankle found pulling began anew
shut eyes strained impossible strength
strength fading quickly
vain cried allahs mercy
suddenly heard swing blade slicing air
opened eyes saw suvan striking taut tentacles sword
two quick hacks free
ruin came horrific squealing made ears ring
began scrambling away thankful miraculous reprieve
fetid hole burst dozen tentacles flailing randomly chance strike attacker
suvan stepped back foot foot sword began making practiced crisscross pattern deadly blade slicing appendage strayed close
face grim panic creature pressed attack
since weapon took chance run
stumbled back road
suvan reach walked calmly join
said disdainfully couldnt leave less hour got trouble
men insufferable
face burning shame smiled broadly suvan glad
chapter dawn approaching glimmer sunlight shining cliff wall
pulling arm suvan led road small ruin
one time must shed structure collapsed leaving nothing tangle debris
part metal roof still intact lying side half covering hole ground
last experience took step backwards pit unsure horror resided within
come suvan said impatiently
completely safe
ive stayed many times
slipped headfirst metal disappeared inside
trepidation joined
found uncomfortable cavity barely enough room two sit
smell dust decay
enterprising spider work leaving mass grey cobwebs got hair
rest suvan said
anyways going daylight soon
mutans force
said youve
made face
told no water wasteland
times must return city get
ive hidden stay sight mutans
nodded
tell creature attacked
shrugged
know care know
evil
lucky came along save
alright lied
laughed softly
doubt
told dangerous valley go walking road like place
told stay outskirts valley yet go investigate anything strikes fancy
dont listen
afraid dont know better since new sort life admitted
besides ive never ewark
work ancients fascinates no end
sigh suvan shook head
suppose used buildings artifacts
hold no interest except profit bring
youll get used time
tell city worth time scavenge
yes mutans strong
take army dislodge city
no merchant take pay number mercenaries needed undertaking
father already written possibility regretfully died leaving last time
stared
come back city
question took suvan surprise
hard time meeting eyes finally replied
came back help
couldnt leave die
touched reached put hand
angrily pulled arm back freeing clasp
thats fool

asked exasperation
way father died
way traders butchered
cant let happen anyone else
mutans must allowed another victim
try get sleep
chance get rest still long way go
said nothing instead closed eyes almost immediately dropped fitful sleep
soon morning came flooding valley light sun
hiding place see mutans using nearby road
hundreds one armed sword bow
paid no attention hiding place instead marching east towards entrance valley
going
asked suvan shaking arm
eyes fluttered open
answered sleepily raid plunder anyone crosses wasteland
beyond
surely no one comes far wasteland
saw burned wagons traders
often come northwest hoping save time cutting across wasteland
think raiding
mean
explained villages towns edge wasteland
mutans raid food
also easy pickings along roads caravans use
least thats heard
shuddered idea

asked

asked annoyance
mean mutans course
arent human exist expanse wasteland
come
shook head said impatiently say like living evil place warped humanity
perhaps hideous leftover days ancients
perhaps cursed allah
doesnt matter
right suggest get sleep since long night hiking ahead
watch
tried sleep
though suvan thought hiding place never discovered still felt exposed
tossing turning finally fell asleep dreaming old bed back destroyed hotel
stuffed feathers soft
wasnt bed like ewark
awoke suvan shaking shoulder
snore said grumpily
thought mutans going discover sound alone
sorry replied sleepily
turn watch said
wake see anything coming way
sky clear one openings see almost dozen strange creatures climbing wall
things seen last night
disgusting
long bodies thick antennae looked like giant black six foot long crickets crawling motion reminded nothing like jumping insect
saw creatures cliff walls last night
asked suvan trying find comfortable position
harmless replied crossly obviously tired questions
feed lichen walls
seen mutans hunt food
stop asking many questions let shut eyes
watch started mid afternoon
stood post kept eye road
stifling inside hole iron sheet soon grew hot touch
boring watching little
sun finally started wane noticed nearby mutan foot traffic began decrease
however twilight came sudden inrush mutans coming direction valley entrance
returning home
chapter dark fell mutan disappeared sight
gently awoke suvan yawned loudly opening eyes
silently ate meal dried lizard meat finishing last water skin
wasnt much meal beginning hunger something else
rations like become thin knife
shall get water commented afterward
little distance
lead way said
crawling hole began walking along outskirts ruins
see towering wall side valley
walls widening making wonder exactly large valley
ruins numerous crowding closely together maze rubble filled streets roads numerous remnants cars also seen rusted metal pitted time
suvan moved cautiously silent ghost
eyes searched along crooks crannies debris
gloom night saw distant circle flickering light ahead
suvan also saw motioned drop back behind
crept silently along empty quiet buildings company
progressed light grew larger larger
roaring fire clearing next collapsed ruin
front blaze score huddled mutans resting haunches
hurriedly hid behind wrecked car
mutan outpost suvan whispered ear
theyre setup various spots city
bother
replied
expect attack
shook head
understand behavior
still get around without seen
go city bypass easily enough
take risk close
going city night wise choice said harshly
unsafe
things far worse tentacled horror almost ate

cause distraction go
meanwhile run across meet side
rusted bridge another four hundred yards
sits water need
suitable place wait
certainly brave though idea foolish
said appreciate willingness sacrifice shall make past together
no fighter said mockingly
give sword show retorted
sigh suvan reluctantly drew sword handed
darkness looked curved blade felt unfamiliar weight steel hand
no swordsman willing kill meant saving life
already killed two mutans
needed
let move said trying sound braver felt
taking bow shoulder suvan adjusted quiver arrows waist
nod head began silently leading ruined avenue
buildings still standing majority fallen choking street debris
progressed saw corner eye flame mutan fire growing brighter
soon low ruined wall separated
hear strange garbled language
suvan moved silently like cat
footsteps sounded loud boots slipped rough ground
elbow accidentally struck nearby wall
suddenly ancient brick clattered fell heavily paved ground reverberating echo
suvan suddenly stopped
nearly ran
stood still holding breath
low talk amongst mutan ceased
shadows see suvan slowly turn face
forefinger hovered lips signaling silence
stood motionless even daring breathe
guttural bark rang hear motion feet heading direction
suvan quickly tugged hand taking sprint
followed suit caring time heard
burst past wall open street
suvan fast runner quickly gaining ground
turning head saw four mutans coming behind
wicked blades glinted weak light moon
picked pace running hard
seconds felt lungs going burst
living comfortable life long kind adventure
mutan camp barrage arrows suddenly passed head
ahead heard suvan give scream
dropped ground writhing pain
catching stopped found lying face arrow sticking right calf
desperately trying pull wedged tightly flesh
darkness fresh blood ground looked black
saw turned face attackers
rushed swords held high malicious leer pasted twisted alien faces
held sword ready
clang steel attacked
swords clashed together
force combined blows made stagger back step
one tried go low lunging blade mid section
sheer luck managed twist away unharmed
taking another step back lunged closest attacker
blade struck mutan fully chest blade penetrating almost hilt
twist arm went agonizing scream
combatants even hesitate upon seeing death comrade instead took chance press attack
air alive swinging blades
took strength whatever little skill keep remaining attackers bay
every step took backwards took closer suvan
allow happen
took chance decided attack
wide arcing sweep blade caught one mutan unaware
blade cleaved deeply creature forearm making drop weapon ear splitting howl
behind heard twang arrow released suvan bow
arrow sunk deeply throat another attacker leaving one standing
remaining mutan showed no concern compatriots
also showed no fear continued violently swing sword aiming head
parried blow used superior strength push back step
though weaker still incredibly fast
sword suddenly slipped downwards breaking contact blade trying plunge upward breast
long reach gave scant time turn away fatal strike
move mutan left exposed
since close use sharp end sword instead used hilt rap remaining mutan hard head
immediately sprawled ground unconscious
mikel
suvan shouted voice wracked pain
turned found sitting bow hand
mutan arrow still stuck deeply leg
immediately reached pull
said impatiently never mind
get moving mutans come way
wont go far beyond light bonfire
chance escape
shoved sword belt picked suvan
grunt draped shoulder started trot forward
looked lighter felt
soon lost darkness ruins
following suvans whispered directions presently found standing narrow footbridge rusted dark years
underneath feet hear slow gurgle passing water
crossed ancient causeway looked saw narrow stream moon shining moving water
bridge led path choked small trees thick weeds
safe
chapter morning come
suvan sleeping tarp head resting weeds
last night pulled arrow calf even let whimper
knew screamed like baby
afterward bound wound tightly extra rag knapsack
little hope mutan arrow tip poisoned
without word fallen fitful sleep ran hand gently along back petting cat
took moment reconnoiter
sword hand began following edge thin stream
one time must large river since ancient sandy banks still evident
middle water see hulk small sailboat half buried stream bed
shore side row ruined buildings empty windows staring silent foreboding
quiet still felt watched
walked along meandering bank depleted river saw path water curving
perhaps small island
minutes suspicions turned correct came back bridge first crossed last night
followed path inwards found suvan left
still sleeping since mutans still nowhere seen decided take time investigate interior
trees weeds grew thicker forming natural wall trespassers
rabbit jumped underbrush ran sight reminding still hadnt eaten morning
getting tired dried lizard thought fresh rabbit stew made mouth water
ignoring rumbling stomach pressed forcing way tangle branches using sword cut bramble
dozen feet weather stained concrete wall standing twice height ending top flat roof thick growing plants
length wall went twenty feet broken three small windows
remarkably glass still intact glazed grime
peering inside see anything darkness
continuing onward slashed undergrowth
followed edge wall got corner
entangled branches lessened able progress less hindrance
found another wall wide metal door set wall
miracle door still white even though no sign paint
hard rap knuckles revealed hollow space behind metal saw no obvious means egress
frustrated continued examination side building
beyond metal door another corner
went past found large attached concrete building series unbroken dirty windows set steps led regular sized door
place looked like home certainly unlike house ever seen
enormous two stories high must belonged wealthy man long dead
felt like trespasser tomb
wanting break windows gain entry climbed stairs tried door
locked
door made rust free material put shoulder hard
hinges pulled easily away wooden frame door fell inside crash causing plume dust rise floor
dim inside enough light see
cautiously entered feeling pay respects dead
floor covered thick inch dust ceiling hung thick tapestry cobwebs
hanging across windows moth holed remnants curtains light outside dimmed years dirt
also sofa legs collapsed floor two chairs faced dusty gray panel attached wall
opening across front door led another room
apart natural decay time house still looked remarkably intact
concrete construction closed egresses elements never chance destructive work
deciding good place hole suvan chance heal returned
found awake looking apprehensive sound footsteps saw
thought left whispered weakly
looked fondly
girl saved life
apologize said trace embarrassment

think fight fought four mutans won
shrugged
nothing
anyway little help
get ground heal
found house stay
looked perplexed
house
island
hidden undergrowth
remarkably good shape intact roof
good place rest ready go
island get water never suspected house
neither anyone else
hotel never seen intact building ancients
even furniture inside use
eyes alive curiosity
take demanded
gently picked suvan cradling arms
rested head shoulder breathing quick shallow
carefully carried house vainly trying keep branches striking
inside spread tarp ruined sofa placed top
suvan looked room eyes wide marveled artifacts
visits cities ive never seen home ancients looted ruined
miracle escaped notice long
perhaps builder place made way purpose
good fortune
dont think mutans even know place
chapter suvan rested sofa started carefully explore rest home
front room next place examine kitchen
dirty ceiling mounted light covered gray dirty cobwebs
lifeless light dusty glass table surrounded four chairs
hallway carpeting left closed door wood right
recognized sink stove cupboards make sense objects
large metal box big enough fit two shoved wall
chrome handle gently pulled no result
harder tug door released grip time
inside boxes containers labeled strange blocky writing
also faint odor decay reminded sour milk
whatever material contained long rotted away turned dust
returning interest cupboards found nothing inside plates glasses carcass dried centipede
drawers turned blackened spoons knives forks
next tried door right
opened easily enough rusted hinges barely protesting movement
large room second ingress outside metal door stymied
inside area nothing jumble hoses gardening equipment wooden handles looking dried fragile
returning kitchen ventured hallway four doors two side
first door practically fell apart opened
small narrow room two sinks bathtub caked dust
fragments mirror scattered floor countertop
next room door already open
one time bedroom
curtains hanging window nothing tattered scraps remnants large bed still occupied
lying moth eaten covers mummified remains person
skull empty sockets stared sightlessly ceiling
body shriveled hideous gray reminding mutan covered moth eaten rags
clutched flesh stripped hand object easily recognized pistol
wrenching gun death grip host no easy matter soon possession
disappointment metal long rusted away
pointing gun wall tried pull trigger expecting old magic still exist nothing happened
disappointed threw gun back bed continued
room also bedroom empty except decayed furniture
last door led stairway heading upwards
suvan
called hall
yes mikel
ghost voice answered front room
havent found anything yet headed upstairs take look around
call need anything
dont gone long said
place starting scare little bit
took stairs cautiously step creaking ominously aged wood protested sudden weight body
stairs ended large room took entire second story
one time must beautiful place walls back house nothing glass
even ceiling row glass windows covered decayed flora rested roof
trees growing close house making outside light turn green shone canopy leaves
vision rippling fauna see two wooden easels paintings long ago faded away
walls paintings nothing faint images
also remnants sofa nearby long box brass ends
box immediately drew attention since except dust remarkably good condition
walked slowly floor creaking uncertainly
got knees examine box closely
sleeve dusted found box heavily covered green paint yellow lettering unfamiliar
clasp front gave twist pulling lid
tight fit eventually managed wrestle box open
inside objects wrapped greasy paper
nervously lifted unwrapping
heaviest package perfectly preserved metal pistol covered thick coating grease
second package covered jar oil dozen small metal cases inside
know went back examining gun
never used one gun ever seen used sub vizier
scrap dusty rag began wiping pistol clean examining parts went
accidentally released catch multi chamber cylinder swung
examined cleaned chambers oil realized metal cases jar fit perfectly
dawned hammer top gun strike end metal case firing bullet attached end
seen sub vizier fire gun somehow make ancient weapon work
removed one metal cases jar marveling compact machining ancients
snugged chamber closed cylinder
hands shaking pointed gun wall
closed eyes pulled trigger
click nothing else happened
opening eyes examined cylinder
case inserted lined hammer
time spun cylinder forward case lined
pulled trigger
ear splitting crack bullet plunged wall shattering plaster satisfying manner
weapon even odds anything possibly encounter
chapter spent entire week house waiting suvan heal
upon first examination found wound particularly nasty
boiled water carefully cleaned deep gash removing whatever dirt find
using needle thread sewed scraps flesh together
strong girl managed cry pain
spent time sofa resting house felt strange almost haunted
like spirits dead still walked halls rooms
always felt uneasy sleeping inside even dragged corpse bury deep forest
spent time exploring island hunting food bow went
fresh water stream availability rabbits birds soon gaining weight
finally walk suvan limped around house examining various artifacts
experience explained workings refrigerator oven ancients used power electricity make work
no one knew make electricity anymore seemed like wondrous invention little short sighted
want depend anything ethereal
man always depend burning wood light oil lamp
kitchen found container made wondrous material called plastic suitable carrying water
added belt carry
amazed pistol discovered claiming one ever seen
rare exclaimed hand gently brushed metal workings
said proudly seen one hands sub vizier
important men
worth fortune
laughed
afraid no one buy
anyway prefer keep
eleven shots left may save lives someday
shrugged
though scavenger know cities well still trust tools ancients
bow sword reliable
replied string bow snap
sword gets nicked dull use
like things tools must cared
gun no different vastly powerful
motioned dusty walls house
ancients everything technology dream
still dead gone
powerful things get poor owner home
face destruction old world decided kill
gun save life
replied wanting drop subject
seeing discomfort smiled
really matter pistol
trust anything understand
fully understand serve protect
spent last day preparing provisions filling containers water
really want leave oasis wasteland knew stay much longer
day seen several mutans coming stream fill water jugs
trails leading island also indicated best leave suvan accidentally discovered
sun slipped away left island returned trail followed canyon wall
block streets passed ruins becoming larger nearby streets crowded rubble
light half moon see buildings still managed stand upright skeleton framework showing broken windows collapsed floors
eerily quiet
world ancients dead ghosts past existed
obvious kalam rebel scouts gone area horseback using speed quickly traverse dangers
foot entirely different situation since mercy mutans strange beast inhabited wretched place
almost dawn stopped look place hole day
passing intersection two streets
habit looked gloomy road check observed
amazement thought saw someone standing front building one hundred yards away
though moonlight waning knew wasnt mutan figure stood taller twisted creatures
excitement pulled suvans sleeve pointed sight
asked impatiently
dont see
suvan began looking street
moment let gasp
took hand started cautiously street using destroyed cars cover
stopped ten yards away seemingly undetected
distance saw man dressed tattered clothes
notice continued stare ahead standing still statue
going take closer look whispered suvans ear
no wait
shouted broke grasp
foolishly ignoring warning stepped onto street quickly approached man
suvans footsteps behind
warning stop
within touching distance ground underneath feet began immediately break away
felt suvan grab arm late
dirt underneath crumbled
fell together hidden pit
second falling hit bottom hard knocking breath
time suvan landed next grunt
immediately engulfed cloud dust added confusion
alright
sheepishly asked suvan
dont think anything broken replied crossly found hand
dust settled sat clutching like children
soon found bottom rough pit approximately six feet diameter
opening fifteen feet away
immobile figure drew trap resting feet
wasnt man type statue made light plastic material
fool suvan said shock abated
trap set mutan
used old shop dummy bait fell
didnt seem catch fact quickly either grumbled
one walked right pit spat
warning werent listening
shrugged
lucky least didnt plant bottom stakes
found already mutan prefer cook food alive suvan sharply reminded
minutes sunrise better start working way mutan comes along discovers
try said little hope since task looked nearly impossible
first tried climb sides walls pit steep
also roughly cut purchase found quickly crumbled hands
fell back exasperation
next attempt merely braced shoulders wall suvan climb top
toes dug painfully top shoulders tried reach edge
far away
jump said gritted teeth
position shifted sending waves pain shoulders
jumped
shower dirt struck head took step backwards looked
hanging onto edge ground already giving away weight
soon fell able catch
collapsed together heap
hurt
asked rubbing jaw head connected fall
fine replied grumpily
dig way said eyed edge pit
take hours isnt enough time
spoke words punctuated lightening sky
dawn coming meant mutans soon prowling streets
dont much choice replied testily
idea dig one side pit causing wall collapse
stand mound eventually creating angled slope leading freedom
dangerous work since risked buried alive wall came quickly
started gingerly removing handfuls dirt time
suvan joined help
sun getting higher every moment
work slowly progressed noticed color earth darker
rich soil suitable farming completely unlike desert
happened cauase change
another mystery consider time
thought direction interrupted movement saw
human head long gray hair peeked edge eyes boring
hoo hoo
man laughed
never expected catch anything like
trap
called
course
replied giggle
else
thought mutans answered
hoo hoo
laughed
silly things never make anything clever wonderfully ingenious
fell
hoo hoo
funniest thing ever seen
looked suvan shook head eyes filled distrust
help
asked hopefully
well dont know
please suvan said
wont much longer mutans come patrolling streets
captured along
hoo
wouldnt dare touch
hold second
face disappeared edge
soon slim rope uncurled pit
made thin blue material slippery touch
motioned suvan take rope
started climbing bringing avalanche dirt
soon
followed suit difficult scramble found back street
suvan standing still bow arrow notched ready go
eyes followed direction gaze saw surrounded hundreds mutans
standing completely still sides blocking sides street
man rescued feet away
back stranger busily untying rope attached destroyed car
straightened began winding rope tidy coil
turned took steps towards
saw eyes mutans follow every move
youre safe sound man said eyes going suvan lustful manner found putting

suvan spat
eyes shining delight
wont hurt long
come follow
walked towards mutans parted let pass
without showing interest towards gray skinned monsters led trash filled stairway protected cracked concrete wall
followed gloom
chapter concrete steps led dark cavernous space rang echo feet
old man took torch propped wall lit
flickering flame revealed standing wide ledge made cracked tiles
number columns supported roof
tunnel far side passed room
without word brought small flight stairs led tunnel
beneath feet four ribbons unbroken rusted metal disappeared darkness
atmosphere dusty foul relieved see mutans followed
suvan finally spoke
name
words echoed tunnel fading whisper
name
dont really remember old man replied uncertainly
everyone name suvan stated
hollow laugh said usually called old one tahn suffice
tell tahn said
exactly
giggled
ancients called subway
used vehicles rode iron rails ferrying people city
tunnels snake streets stations giving access ground
ive found best way travel without hindrance
course tunnels dangerous good know way around
tried think something like cars driving underground hard time imagining anyone want
much better see sun travel gloomy passageway like
suvan practical asked taking
tahn replied grumpily questions questions either ever run questions
going home course
talk something eat dear
suvan persistent type
asked tell mutans leave alone
sighed
always left alone
left father alone father
family lived city since beginning time
mutans decided wise ways ancients
since descended power ancients wisdom sacrosanct
like holy man
asked skeptical outlandish idea
tahn shrugged
call
trap fell
capture mutans
hoo hoo
mutans
nothing discover replied cryptically
no looking new specimens add collection
always new creatures born wasteland especially city
study
no questions
glanced suvan shrugged shoulders resignation
continued walking
darkness tunnel time distance lost meaning
tahns torch light source flames casting long shadows dirty brick walls
passing several silent stations finally stopped metal door tucked side wall
gentle tug tahn door swung open ease reveal flight stairs
hope tired said
long climb front
promise good lunch though
long time since ive company
fine suvan replied
said
tahn giggled habit finding annoying
said well hope
started climbing
stairs perfectly preserved noticed sound boots made metal painted white many times
every dozen steps stairs stopped landing metal door
door number painted incremented went
time reached number twenty breathing becoming labored
saw suvan also tiring effort dismay tahn looking amused
seemed suffer no ill effects climb
perhaps used
hoo hoo
thought two youngsters able keep
dont worry suvan managed gasp
kept tongue said nothing instead concentrating task hand
stop climbing stairs reached door painted number thirty two
tahn extinguished torch dumping lit end bucket sand
opened door flooding stairwell sunlight
suvan entered blinking
eyes adjusted saw massive room ceiling supported row evenly spaced pillars
jumbles ancient artifacts piled everywhere along messy bed table modest nature
amazing part walls
nothing glass way around
building stood deep group skeletal ruins made metal fragments glass
streets laid regular pattern
east also see riverbed trickle water carried
view horizon spectacular walls canyon clearly visible
felt like see miles
suvan let breath
amazing
tahn cackled delight
glad think dear
waved hand direction buildings
compared ruins place free decay
lot hard work tell story lets food first
exactly eat
asked imagining rats even mutan flesh
let show replied proudly
tahn led back stairway
climbed upwards went one flight last landing
went doorway roof building
inside glass structure exceedingly humid
floor long wooden troughs healthy plants growing inside
immediately recognized tomatoes melons lettuce green beans myriad produce
never seen anything like
ever heard growing plants indoors
tahn talking proudly
greenhouse provides food need
water comes rain filled cistern tanks
works rather well though getting old bend working garden
lets return downstairs lunch
lunch turned vegetable stew
particularly tasty still better lizard meat
afterward brought three glasses red wine
good either beat water drinking past days
drank tahn started rambling length
wasteland survived long enough make heart city
seen dangerous murderous mutans evil creatures live kill
no place safety building mine
fresh food fresh water
mutans dare approach
true agreed wondering telling
continued need help
building requires constant repair maintenance stop father time taking rightfully
gardening alone takes hours time every day
need free time research figure makes technology ancients tick causes creatures mutate wasteland
looked
willing help
stay days help replied thankfully
glad another chance rest pushed mountains
guess suvan replied little conviction
chapter afternoon suvan sent begin working garden followed tahn another level building
instead great room like floor lived eyes greeted dimly lit hall
visible light torch hand faint light coming cracks around several doors
one many laboratories tahn commented reached nearest door handle
floor let say different interest
ushered inside nearly dropped torch disgust
far wall two dingy windows let light outside filter
center room shiny metallic table surrounded four unlit oil lamps
rested table horrid thing defied imagination motionless creature roughly size man structure bone purple skin made unique almost baroque structure
three long spindly legs fat almost bulbous torso five thick arms thought monster never possibly walk unaided
pale red face bore no resemblance anything human animal looking like distorted assembly unrelated parts
five eyes arranged haphazard fashion around two holes must served nostrils
two mouths one located cheek bared open reveal row razor like teeth
beauty
tahn said glee
swallowed pushing rising bile back throat
find horrible thing
laughed manner sent chill spine
surprised turns darker corners city
seen things give nightmares rest life
come help get ready dissect specimen
light lamps lay instruments
instruct proper methods surgery
lit oil lamps laid equipment suggested stood aside watched tahn went work
deft hand scalpel cutting flesh practiced ease
organs inside removed one closely examined
part done used saw remove top skull
brain tissue carefully removed examined placed inside labeled jar
speak actions sense detachment actually barely stand horror
insides felt like jelly
wanted look away tahn made sure pepper comments questions terrible work
finished carcass covered rough cloth
worked together lifting remains table placing cart
pushed room hall
tahn help wrestled body metal chute disappeared
asked distastefully exactly learn
much replied obviously picking apparent disgust
fairly common humanoid mutation perhaps even related mutans
worthless working
exactly working
asked afraid hear answer
smiled eyes gazing nothingness
improve flock course
mutans
asked incredulous
spoke like loving father
like children
like loving parent want make sure survive world
kill eat people protested
party horrible thing
stared expression unfathomable
reasons
like see mutans born
sure replied renewed sense sickness
come bad
words tahn led stairway took several flights reached floor twelve
opened door let pass first
stench inside unbearable reminding excrement rotted flesh
large area took entire floor
rows rows foot wide metal boxes floor small gray hands clambering get
sound little prisoners mix horrific wailing toddler gibberish
line windows provided light though wished sight mention forever invisible
middle room sat gigantic pod flesh twenty feet long horribly mottled gray spots
one end large orifice oozed yellowish liquid substance staining floor
side body mutan vacant black eyes small breasts spindly arms
stomach lurched finally realized seeing female species
tahn sounded like lovelorn teenager said beautiful
father father discovered lowest darkest part city
place even deeper subways
brought back experiment wondering thing exist
course smaller took readily steady diet meat vegetables
amazement given seed offspring
first mutan created
seed
asked dumbfounded
yes original father mutans
like father
felt strong urge run man sword stopped
suvan needed escape trapped right heart mutans without clear way
killing insane man hasten death
tahn suddenly said seen enough today
perhaps shown help brag accomplishments
let go eat dinner
arrived top floor light sun already starting fade
found suvan still busy garden intently removing weeds soil cistern watering plants
face streaked dirt clothes definitely seen better days
tahn watched bright shiny eyes
sickening
felt burst jealous anger course veins
abominable think disgusting old man even thinking manner
said perhaps two better clean eat suggested
use water cistern
go prepare dinner
suvan readily agreed idea took bucket get water
tahn left followed outside help
water ran bucket said low tones must escape tonight mutans sleeping
nodded movement barely visible
like way looking
trust believe saw
tell later
enough time right
get
shrugged
perhaps backtrack way came
washed two returned inside went floor
tahn cooking familiar smell simmering vegetables greeted nostrils
felt sick memory seen still strong stomach
food done tahn bade sit table
seated poured wine ladled stew
ate drank tahn kept quiet unexpected
instead talking kept glancing two expecting something happen
though tasted wine unfamiliar tang
stopped drinking pretended placing rim glass lips
nonetheless tiny amount consumed effect
head felt thick sleep
feel tired managed blurt
wanted tahn think close unconsciousness
ignoring words turned attention suvan barely eyes open
consumed wine
finally spoke lonely
father mother dead last one alive carry work ancestors started long time ago
gone someone need carry work keep place going
need someone give son
jaw dropped astonishment
words took moment register suvan
head jerked
mean
gasped weakly
else mean beautiful girl
murmured abruptly slumped onto table
tried stand protest found legs like lead
tahn smiled
two get sleep
need tomorrow since plenty work
chapter fell partially unconscious still feel someone rummaging jacket
moment sound paper unfolded
heard tahn laugh sound piercing layers drug
still felt strangely disconnected reality strength pry eyes open
saw moment filled revulsion
tahn standing sleeping suvan running hands greedily along narrow body
muttering
pretty one
anger inside brushed away lingering sleepiness felt
tahn even knew happening rose chair struck solidly side head
moaned crumpled slid side
suvan even react burst violence continued sleep
pulled roughly chair
began walking suvan around room vain attempt wake
toes dragged uselessly floor
couple circuits around room began tire placed back chair
shook shoulders yelled face
relief suvan finally peeled opened eyes
looked distastefully

come must leave
hurry
asked sleepily shutting eyes
immediately light snore gurgled past throat
shaking head decided let rest minutes
spend time packing food leave tahn awoke
looking floor fallen saw astonishment disappeared
quick search room revealed nothing
tahn managed leave without trace
hardly surprising since knew building better anyone
moved quickly filling canteens water backpack whatever food find
dining table found map rebel hideout note tai
wondered tahn found interest either one
shook suvan
time managed stay awake eyes blurry sleep
tahn
asked looking room
answered sure remember drugged wine
seems wanted stay permanently
slave wife
made face disgust
old man
never
dont think going give much choice matter
may old also knows much ancients
knows done
killed wouldnt around protect
suggest leave comes back
upon hearing suvan stood straight new blaze energy
theres no time waste
left taking door stairs
torch tahn used gone
instead propped door open started descend gloom
already dim natural light top floor gone two flights stairs
soon lost near darkness
luckily minor light still filtered doors landings
much enough slowly make way first floor
take tunnels
asked
light lost
fear number mutans surface
still day
long
shall find somewhere hide night comes
feel even safer leave accursed city
reached first floor without incident neither seeing hearing sign tahn
tried door relief opened easily enough
stench death hit square face almost causing retch
long corridor led left right
along walls steel doors set every ten feet
floor set gray tile thin film dust
dust wheel tracks looked made cart used
suvan covering nose hand
place
asked
know replied
ive already seen bet pleasant
trying handle nearest door swung open noiselessly
inside small room two levels shelves side wall
shelves white sheets covering objects differing sizes
directly across door also large unbroken window streaked dirt
metal bars covered outside
remaining daylight filtered dimly glass
rubble filled street seen
plucking courage entered room approached shelf
suvan remained doorway watching large eyes
gritted teeth grabbed corner sheet
quick yank cloth fell floor
revealed monstrous creature looked like childish version mutan
reminded little groping hands mutan birthing room
perhaps one strong enough live
misshapen eyes stared lifelessly
pulled another sheet free eyes greeted yet another mutan child
make sense tahn keep things
turning attention back suvan saw looking sick
said gently come let go
taking hand continued looking way madhouse
end hallway two doors hung together
small windows set eye level
panes yellow age still transparent
peered saw large room metallic table middle floor
top slab motionless human like creature
around two smaller tables knives rust stained saws jars filled dark liquids
scene right nightmare
however another door far side room
know lead find

suvan asked low voice full fear
want know replied clenched teeth
want let scared actually
let go way
turned double door side hall swung open
tahn
behind horde mutans blades held ready
wave hand creatures rushed hall towards fearsome cry
shoving suvan doors behind reached pocket took pistol
enough time take careful aim bound hit something way bunched together
flick trigger gun fired
satisfying bang lead mutan fell like rag
stop others continued frontal assault
pulled trigger three times shot easily finding target
mutans fell dead compatriots mass sprawling bodies
took chance duck behind doors
except corpse room empty
door side open
two strides
type supply room filled boxes hardware
suvan cowering corner eyes wide fear
quickly shut door behind looking way block entry since no lock
help
shouted suvan
rose stupor began piling boxes door
hold hissed
cant go shot back
whats
suvan suddenly said pointed grating wall
stacked boxes door began rock back forth
mutans trying push way
leaving suvan steady barricade boxes quickly went grate
large enough person crawl
saw screws corner rusted age
hard yank pulled ancient metal free wall breaking screws process
small tunnel sorts led darkness
get
shouted suvan
busy pushing boxes failing bulk massed mutans
door started reluctantly open revealing clawing gray hand
impatiently reached physically pushed towards open grate
suvan took hint disappeared tunnel
followed behind pulling grate
closed mutans broke open door rushed room
waited shadows pistol hand
foul beasts screamed rage found somehow disappeared
boxes equipment tossed aside vainly searched
took moment slowly crept backwards gloom narrow tunnel
chapter tunnel dark narrow dusty smelling many years past
made metal rippled sound went
cobwebs got entangled hair imagine state already abused clothing
ahead see dark form suvan edging blindly forward
relief sound mutans became distant every passing moment
passageway soon ended intersection divided left right passageway
way want go
suvan whispered
frightened voice echoed metallic walls
doesnt matter replied much confidence muster
take direction want long gets away infernal creatures
matter time tahn figures gone
surely mutans follow
afraid dark
chuckled
organized torches surely follow orders darkness
without word suvan took right tunnel followed
said holy man
mutans follow orders
suvan asked
shudder hesitantly replied actually holy man
father
stopped mid crawl making nearly run
mean
keep moving explain
many cities ancients
yes course said resumed moving
said never seen mutans anywhere else
place know live
makes place special
conviction replied curse ancients
evil spawned beasts decay ruins
spawn somewhere agreed
seen eyes mutans bred hands tahn ancestors
nearly shouted impossible
allah create take life away
saw female mutan alive replied quietly
breeds rather go detail
tahn hand raising propagating species
building army follow every command
preposterous said finality
let matter drop since pressing issues hand
darkness totally complete cautiously feel way forward
tunnel also descending alarming rate
since started ground floor meant headed somewhere towards basement
even worse new sounds reverberating walls
sounded like mutans inside tunnels tell far away
suvan stopped swore
go
choice
drop warned
voice rose frustration
far
risk
let breath
spun around took hands began lowering
held tightly listened feet kicked side smooth metallic walls
slowly inched forward allowing drop
time arms stretched way pit heart beating hard ears
think feel bottom suvan voice drifted
released hands
immediately heard light thud
relief quickly dispelled flicker light coming behind
turned head saw burning torch
line mutans coming inclined tunnel hesitant pace
ugly features lead mutan made even worse shadows cast flickering flame
pulling pistol pocket fired
bullet hit beast square face
pitched back slid towards torch flailing wildly air
stopped foot grabbed still lit torch
mutans put yell charged
waiting longer pushed backwards dropped
hit floor loud metallic clang
luckily suvan moved way crushed sudden flight
light liberated torch revealed small dirty room square openings walls mummified mice floor
suvan staring wild face streaked dust
hear mutans screaming panic since lost source light
matter time came
easier join returning along twisty corridors whence came
trapped suvan finally said
nonsense replied
way
see nothing behind openings fans
ancients must used tunnels move air building
whoever maintained building access room
exclaimed
without word began examining walls aid torch
suvan said egress blocked fan composed five blades grouped tightly together
no one fit past rust encrusted fans
investigation halted arrival mutan
fell ground painful sounding crack
chance rise unsheathed swiped sword
cut opened throat causing creature thrash gurgle terrible moan
black blood stained floor
suvan stared new horror moment started help go ancient prison
moment time discovered part metal wall fit differently others
flush edge door
gave push hand budge
near panic gave violent kick sent bolt pain entire leg
time thin metal buckled portion wall sprung open
small opening large enough someone pass
even said word suvan began struggling opening
legs kicked free gone
follow two mutans thudded metallic floor
spun around drew sword
foul creatures moved fast time rushed blades ready
slashed took feeble skills dodge parry blows
one blade sliced open shirt barely touching flesh
took lit torch shoved attacker face
turning away clutched eyes screamed dropping blade
one mutan left able use longer reach
quick work sword struck straight chest
let groan slid floor
took chance pushed opening
shutting trapdoor behind found suvan waiting outside accursed metal cage
expression one relief
handed torch
room jumble broken machinery covered layer dust
dim light torch see door sagging hinges
inside metal enclosure came noises
mutan panic escape
matter minutes discovered way
free soon warned suvan
sorry got scared
hate admit anyone like confined spaces
arent one said soothingly
enough talk get building tahn sends creatures
pushed aside door hinges gave way causing fall forward crash
going found short hallway flight stairs went upwards another steel door across way
place tahn used enter building subway
tunnels place wanted go right wasnt much choice
chapter fear lost suvan said minutes walking
fear mutans replied
tahn knows tunnels better
shall find way trapped
subway tunnel went straight hundred yards slowly curving right
occasional rat sound heard feet treading across ground
light torch flickered uncertainly wondered much longer last going
hellish trapped without able see
behind thought hear echo many feet
turned look shoulder saw lights behind bouncing strange shadows tunnel walls
mutans started search subway
grabbed suvans hand pulled along faster pace
hurry said fighting panic felt welling inside
began running headlong flight unconcerned lie ahead
no matter speed lights behind grew intensity since mutans move untiring pace
came split tunnel rail lines separated
without thinking took rightmost one
next hear suvans breath winded rasps
tiring wasnt much better
made yards suvan stopped
rest gasped
fear drugged wine still affecting
cant
theyre right behind
screamed
entreaties late
flash light behind
looked group torch holding mutans mouth new tunnel
saw amazement proceed
instead stopped eyes warily examining tunnel walls
take time consider caution instead dragged suvan along
relief mutans follow branch tunnel
paused wonder first thought flight
think gentle patter feet echoing walls front
first thought mutans trapped since remained dark ahead knew something different coming recesses underground maze
also rank unfamiliar smell
feet see piles white bones skull leered
sound footsteps grew louder
stopped pushed suvan side
crouched near tunnel wall notched arrow drew back bow
torch hand flickering dangerously low still enough light see approaching horror
instead multitude creatures single one
beast forever inhabit deepest nightmares terrible fears
outlandish mutation like centipede made human parts
legs instead multitude arms gray mottled hands
horrific appendages supported thick maggot like body twelve feet length
one time flesh may pink years underground living turned black dirt grime
head call miniscule compared bulk body
looked like head infant malicious row teeth red eyes certainly held no childish innocence
suvan let go bow arrow pierced body sinking deeply bloated flesh
creature let horrific scream sounded like child crying pain volume made head dizzy
blood came thick black
still beast kept coming appendages moving terrific rate
without thought fired pistol snap bullet echoing hallway
shot hit arm slow nightmare
pulled trigger nothing happened except click moment sounded terribly loud
haste escape forgotten reload
no time anymore
slipped gun pocket reached sword
draw blade creature top raising girth flail wall arms
moved amazing speed took surprise
hit terrific number blows sent reeling away staggering fought stay upright
twang suvans bow rang next ear
beast howled ear splitting scream arrow sunk deeply hideous body
aim head
shouted drew sword
thing came raising body rain series blows
time sword ready
swept blade towards flailing arms cutting ragged line flesh
great spasm shot body recoiled pain
still attack stop
time creature charged head engulfed tangle arms weight body pushing ground
sword arm pinned torch wrenched grip
rubbery mass choked air
couldnt breathe
world began spin away darkness
felt consciousness slip away
beast gave sudden violent shudder rolled
ribs ached pain felt rush air greet lungs
opened eyes saw suvan standing
looking concern eyes holding flickering torch hand
alright
asked
think gasped
help
assistance soon feet
entire body ached luckily nothing seemed broken
saw creature dead head pierced well placed arrow
wrestled ground gave chance aim explained
near thing gratefully agreed
let move mutans get brave enough follow
hope meet anything else like said disgust
horrible
moved walking carefully past monster
relief soon came upon station platform
moments climbing flight garbage strewn stairs night
buildings loomed
still heart city still joy free subways
reached top stairs suvan extinguished torch grabbed arm
let take look proceed whispered ear
peering edges stairwell suvan motioned join
saw street empty living thing crowded wrecked cars litter
appeared entire population city tried flee time destroyed monstrous weapon
suvan prompting began cautiously moving forward
due wrecked cars street take sidewalk strewn cracked plastic containers broken glass metallic wrappers broken bits buildings
buildings towered casting ungodly long shadows pointing away moon
deathly quiet except cool breeze gusted street kicking trash
find place hide rest suvan said breaking silence
know
stayed subway
mutans sure find
suvan visibly shuddered
no safer
go
rather die
walking another block came building must store one time
glass front long gone inside plastic mannequins tattered clothing stared lifelessly
doors torn open time ground inside littered decayed goods past
suvan said relief
rest scavenge place something useful
entered stepping cautiously scattered trash
elements done damage though place also looted ancients even mutans
progressed litter started give away collapsed shelves racks still held moth eaten rotted clothing
setup camp back recesses store
suvan fell fitful sleep heap tattered clothing took first watch
gently snored went provisions wondered long live scraps food two canteens water
long trip ahead werent going get valley supplies
putting thoughts aside reloaded pistol last remaining bullets
no extra ammunition use five shots left
based run far wasnt going enough get valley alive
glad still sword power suvans bow
chapter taking turns sleeping spent rest night next day hidden store
rising sun mutans outside busily marching streets
perhaps searching
slept suvan scoured littered remnants around found additional clothing wear
green jacket made plastic type material impervious water prove useful ever reached mountains
darkness came streets became deserted
left camp began traversing empty streets
skeletal buildings continued silent watch oppressive presence constant reminder days past
gigantic tomb home hundred horrors
also monument folly mankind civilization build majesty yet destroy easily
ever see destruction
thoughts broken whispering suvan
said horror subway think others
hesitated answering know
wonder things created
tahn hand monster
product ancient folly
replied
description taken mutations turned purpose
evil allah
punished folly
right concerns morality
must get back trail escape city
rations low survive far desert
food water low agreed
concern
still run mutans
know city
tahn bidding searching throughout day perhaps even night
never seen use torches shows adapting new circumstances
still afraid dark said confidently
obedience tahn allowed temporarily overcome fear
anyway find plenty places hide day
shall get end valley safety mountains
gave sigh despair
never come journey
lead death
tell thought lies end valley
mutans guard exit enough numbers stop breaking
impossible reach desert without running
probably story entrance
trapped inside like rats unless think clever way
shall find another way answered crossly
perhaps subway tunnels come somewhere else
going back said firmly
rather die blade mutan visit accursed tunnels
may wish spat back angrily
better ideas
immediately answer stopped listened make sure conversation drawn attention creature night
moment replied softly
know done better alternatives climb
stunned idea felt foolish coming
stopped talking momentarily scramble rusted car blocked sidewalk
back sidewalk finally replied walls cliffs steep
really think possible climb
try
first shall find rope possible food
hit desert isnt going much time hunting
also worried water
wasteland easy go canteen day
know get
shook head
ive never beyond river
either return depend luck
spent rest night walking lookout mutans
since depended torchlight traveling night no problem find way around
patrols see easy dodge
light morning came found remnants bank hole
floor covered blackened silver green copper coins strange faces unknown writing imprinted metal
vault door shut budge tried move ancient door
suppose matter useless things resided inside still curious
spent day inside taking turns keeping watch street outside
except sound passing mutans undisturbed
middle next night cleared heart city
buildings becoming fewer number growing even less frequent went
march suvan continued search certain type store find proper tools scale cliff side
nearing dawn found looking
large building front must glass one time
windows broken long ago shards covered sand
roof half collapsed allowing moonlight shine
goods inside scattered destroyed elements towards back store still intact shelves
suvan entered immediately began searching dusty items
finished pile goods feet
said ancients called sporting goods store
found good rope
daylight comes take closer look see else scavenge food
rope
anything old sure disintegrate weight
laughed
like ropes village made hemp twisted together made plastic like one use tahn rescued pit
material last many lives still strong enough hold many times weight
food drink
asked
water still problem ancients also way storing food make last long time
shook head
like rope
plastic food
no silly man shot back
people old ate food much like ways storing preserving food inside sealed containers
didnt understand
like canning
keep fruit fresh many years centuries
no one knows food last long time indeed
store carries special type used camping ancients apparently hobby
though sure anyone activity
lighter shall examine place
usual took turns sleeping early dawn light began slanting demolished roof
suvan went work kept watch prowling enemies
hidden position inside store watch street thankfully remained empty mutans
completed task suvan called show fruits labors
front feet small pile boxes metallic pouches
best ones find said

asked began poking hungrily rations
food though food requires addition water edible
shall still need find
remember important smell perhaps sample insides spoilage unless mind sick stomach
beef chicken soup rice lasagna even scrambled eggs
looked packaging found writing indecipherable
tell suvan actually read writing ancients
shrugged
know words
father taught knew
really comes job
visiting many cities start getting feel language
made decision
sat suvan told everything happened really going mountains
done pulled tai note tunic showed
may say something important
make anything
took paper hand
minute concentrated studying shook head
afraid far technical
words know simple ones dealt father work mostly regarding matters food goods
something beyond understanding
think really important
honestly know lost everything
told rebels mountains read language
one reasons forced go journey warned mujadeens plans
keep safe
thank showing mikel
nice know trust
chapter stayed store rest day hidden behind tall empty shelf
using precious water canteen first sampled food ancients
beef stew salty rather bland meal still satisfying hungry stomach
suvan ate chicken soup also sampled even saltier beef stew
strange consume something old innards rebel
full belly dozed next suvan coming night
suvan shook shoulder awoke
gathered supplies left store went night
carried lengths rope coiled right shoulder
suvan took food
changed directions time striking due north towards cliff walls
air still hidden menace night no sign mutans horrific creature
went past familiar ruins destroyed cars taking precaution losing footing rubble trash littered streets
sometime later reached without incidence cliff
point rose dizzying heights shadowed wall cold black
cover night see nary handhold crevice navigate
wall creatures seen dark lumps moving slowly without heat sun
hope climb night commented examined wall hands
let continue along wall replied
height drop get close exit
make climb easier
readily assented since misgivings idea
going difficult climbing rock lessening height help
began picking way westward heading towards exit accursed valley
no rest journey feet aching suvan finally stopped pointed
glow horizon ahead light nothing rising sun behind
morning still early
mutans said thinking suvans prediction come true
closed exit lit bonfires
way surely guarded escape
go no suvan said
close
looked wall
shorter still apparently smooth impassable
even climb section
looks no better
reply tinged exhaustion
let rest
long night
answer question go back go no shall climb
seen cliff side daylight ways thought looked difficult
best wait daylight comes find necessary footholds
spent rest night talking eating food ancients
splash water left water bottle knew suvan little remaining canteen
return river search another source within valley
escape take consequences wasteland beyond
dawn broke along eastern sky finally make irregularities rock face
good one hundred feet desert
though handholds outcroppings see ascent possible provided care taken
laid length rope tying together twenty feet distance
lengths rope used create safety points tie case one slip
suvan went first nimbly finding foothold handhold pull
went rope grew tauter followed trying use spots found
slow going
felt like fly wall
surprise looked saw already thirty feet ground
wind picking making feel vulnerable whistled past ears
sun already baking wall turning coldness night hot stone
wall creatures left grazing spots lichen like content cattle
rope creaked
looked saw suvan stop outcropping
took length rope tied around waist tying onto rock
lifeline case one fell
brushed terrible thought aside instead concentrated task hand
foot agonizing foot slowly pulled using rope sparse footholds
feet hurt throat parched thirst fought
half way heard faint cry
craning neck looked saw nothing
still felt growing apprehension
muscles strained pulled another foot using small handhold
cry became louder
looked time saw single mutan staring
quite distance away standing top pile rubble middle street
damned thing calling brothers minutes whole host fire arrows
sure infernal creatures find great sport killed manner
called suvan company
hurry
suvans lithe figure began moving rapidly rock face
surprised speed hard time keeping
several times rope went taut causing slow gain another foothold
paused tie another rope outcropping tying end waist removing previous one
took moment look saw mutans running direction
going close
sudden burst energy suvan finally pushed ledge
left alone rock face
clambered past last outcropping rested foot took much needed breath
mistake
arrow shot past within inches head bounced rock face
looked saw single mutan drawing bow
started climbing back clenched ready receive deadly iron tip
heard another cry sounded like creature pain
took chance look saw mutan lying back arrow protruding back
thirty yards away stood figure wearing black robe hood covered face
carrying bow
wave direction stranger ran disappear ruined buildings close
forgotten mysterious follower wonder fit
however respite temporary since dead mutan replaced several comrades still much alive
small knot creatures gathered together drawing back bows release hail arrows
saw glance hand found ledge
savage yank pulled
black arrows mutans flew head ended landing soft sand beyond
suvan helped
face flushed said must hurry leave valley hunt
bad fortune seen climbing
took run heading north desert
trackless wasteland felt strangely empty compared crowded ruined city
no shade heat relentless sun soon sweating profusely
stopped momentarily rest made suvan angry
no time
shouted
want mutans capture work
see man dressed black
asked breathing hard
talking
replied impatiently
must seen
saved life killing mutan infernal creature draw bead
shook head
didnt see anyone
isnt time talk right
take much effort mutans track desert sand
way escape distancing
shook canteen
nearly empty
last long water
better idea
snapped
turn shake head
no way stand fight overpowering force
option flee hope best
began running
sun grew higher baking yellow sand fiery haze
lithe figure suvan easily outpaced
whenever gain much distance stop let catch
angered since gave time rest constantly moving
words encouragement little help either made mood malicious
really wasnt aware danger facing labored crest high sand dune
forced stop top rest turned looked behind
shimmering edge horizon make mass figures moving towards
moving good pace easily faster
wouldnt much longer caught
shaking head wondered horrors city better place die
ran
lungs wracked pain legs felt like leaden stumps moved willed
throat parched tongue felt thick mouth dare drink last remnant water
dont know kept going perhaps fear cooked alive evil creatures
perhaps fear coming far defeated
even strongest wills halest bodies take much
much
no
dropped knees heat sand engulfing like wave
taking cap water bottle swallowed last stale remnant
tasted like best wine world
suvan stopped quickly ran join
flushed heat looked barely stand
must keep going gasped
cant replied uneven breathing
go without
wont leave replied testily
kill
stay fight
shook head
result death
no stay slow
anyways stopping going faster
reached pocket took note
take
head towards mountains deliver message
took paper hands stared stupidly slipped inside pocket
suvan leaned kissed sweaty forehead
without word left running hard
chapter one think one imminent death marching horizon
point really thinking anything
tired
still thirsty wanted nothing glass cold water
since available instead readied final end
gave prayer allah hoping recognize bravery
mostly watched mutan drew ever closer
least three dozen foul creatures
no chance numbers
mutans normally aggressive behavior seemed oddly muted since drew closer pace slowed
perhaps suspicious nature perhaps strange sight single man sitting sand no mind flee express terror
maybe suspected trap marching line bent middle flanks swept left right
soon encircled no means escape
circle silent mutans slowly drew closer together like noose
stood
forward motion stopped
one laughed causing others join
whatever evil thoughts passed twisted minds imagine no pity chance appeal
loud rasp mutans drew swords time dropping bows sand
started towards tight leer cruelty frozen terrible faces
remained motionless barely keeping fear check
experienced much suffering much pain truly scared anymore
going die going without whimper
without single word drew blade suddenly charged towards first mutan straight across
movement threw
time respond sword point drove deeply heart
wrench pulled sword free shoved past dying mutan
free circle still danger
temporary respite eventually surrounded
merely putting inevitable buying time suvan escape
without fear nearest mutan right rushed
parries swords went slash neck
soon two take place
longer reach helped hard time keeping slashes jabs bay
downed one blow neck slipped guard slashed leg
began bleeding heavily thigh
sight wound put mutans bloody fury
three joined battle
time no place turn escape
took step back kept blade swinging defensive pattern
whirl sword sang heat air crashing metallic clangs loud enough make blink
another mutan got close cheek ended getting sliced open
still managed lunge forward pierced free arm
pain white hot
blood bled freely wound making dizzy cold sickness
began lose track time
sun beat back relentless ferocity
throat parched feeling dry desert floor
aching sword arm barely keep persistent attacks
no chance rest
no chance live
mutans new sport enjoyed like trapped rat sharp teeth
sword black blood sharp blade nicked hundred blows
know many fell sword attack never faltered
legs soon buckled exhaustion
fell knees
remaining enemies gave horrific cheer
weak lift sword arm
weak anything watch death
one mutans particularly loathsome specimen twisted lips black eyes cautiously approached sword ready
nothing jabbed hard chest
steel bit flesh burst white hot pain
creature laughed screamed cracked voice
felt blood trickle chest spreading like blossom shock
mutan lifted sword high air ready deliver killing blow
closed eyes fell onto chest sand clogging nose mouth
heart pounded chest sounding like drumbeat ears
heard mutans give blood curdling howl still final blow never came
opened dirt encrusted eyes slowly turned aching head
mutans running
dawned horses
men horses charging mutans rushing pick discarded bows
speed horses won
flash spear points dozen mutans died spot
watch remnants mutans broke flee run one one
men horse dressed sand colored robes hoods covered head left face open
reminded mysterious follower dressed black
nonetheless men job grim determination letup final mutan killed
slaughter finally stopped rescuers lined raised spears
least twenty
gave ear piercing war cry another rider rode
man hood pushed back shoulders
hair iron gray face lined years living sun
riding saddle behind arms wrapped around waist suvan
released grip jumped soon side
weak move smiled weakly
praise prophet still alive
exclaimed
hand began run body examining wounds earnest
men
heard asking
voice sounded faint faraway
rebels replied began bound wounds
sun cut shadow man
rider borne suvan
stared blue eyes cold ice
vinc said
miracle killed many mutans single handed
day long remembered song never seen man slay eight creatures
tried nod motion much
faces faded away
slipped darkness
chapter awoke bath unnatural white light made blink annoyance
lying top bed mass pillows supported aching head
body felt stiff dull throbbing pain reminding still alive
strange light made flame power sun
turning head looked room
next small white table held clean bandages several needles length thread
walls painted white closed door
curtains single window drawn
knowing decided investigate
getting bed proved much
pulled covers back put bare foot cold floor tried stand without success
instead sort sprawled falling floor knees
found dressed nothing thin white robe
help
cried
door soon opened
strode prim looking woman undetermined years
like room dressed white frock pair paints
doctor fit
bed
demanded know ugly face creased worry

answered barely hidden smile
hospital course
amazing alive
took several transfusions doctor interesting time stitching back together
transfusion
asked ignorance
laughed mirth practiced gravedigger
blood simple man
lost much doctor put back
felt faint feeling sick stomach thinking stranger blood circulating inside
good patient let help get back bed
readily complied wishes
strength resist
safely tucked away asked tell companion
traveling girl named suvan
said patiently worry spent hours side
poor thing tired keeping watch went got sleep room
nodded drowsily
suggest get sleep
time best healer still long way go better
final words turned left closing door went
falling back sleep easier expected
dreamed nothing
seemed like minutes passed suddenly felt shoulder gently shaken
opened eyes saw suvan sitting side
wearing new tunic pants little large build
smiled glad know still alive
happy see said face beaming excitement

croaked
long story mikel
left desert ran ahead fearing last ever see
soon ran horsemen explained situation rode rescue
afraid rather suspicious first told plight ready help
leader man vinc men charge right mutans
splendid see
saw wounded grieved
thought going lose
looked death door
admitted
afterward vinc men tie horse rider help
headed towards mountains dodging past mutan patrols
days journey remained unconscious
bad since missed seeing wonders
rebels live way astounds
like visiting time ancients
look light
bulb runs electricity
vinc busy showing everything
looked shining light found wonderful
bright artificial tastes
continued brought doctor stitched wounds healed
many days
asked
two days
note
shrugged
gave vinc
said deliver council behalf
strength shall meet
spent next two days bed
time ate plenty food slept hours away
suvan came visit spending much free time visiting local sights
jealous since window see pine trees granite slabs
seemed like long time doctor finally released hospital allowing tour rebel town company suvan
proved good guide explained everything
really small village protected natural formations rock stone
stream ran cold snow mountain peaks
water also ran dam generated electricity
scavenging city valley managed find necessary light bulbs material run wiring
amazing think something simple make power create light flick switch
stream also provided running water pumped various buildings four five dozen homes simple thatched huts insulated straw mud
grouped together along dirt paths sprawled random directions
hospital town hall built ancients
much like hotel made brick tarred roofs
town hall small library books even workshop men tried replicate work old days
fantastic enterprise considering limited manpower
gone town hall suvan stopped river watch water rush
grateful rest
sat together
wanted hold hand felt strangely shy even though shared terrible adventures together
think place
suvan asked interrupting thoughts
impressive expecting something replied
like
waved hands direction houses
must two three hundred residents
hardly army take mujadeen spread wide far
warlord said lead massive army easily crush something insignificant
suvan shook head disagreement
look technology
done far anywhere else seen
towns wasting away building anew
light water demand give men fight
right new voice interrupted
vinc
time dressed rough clothes laborer stern face no one mistake simple worker
well
time meet council
come
stood follow saw give suvan look longing gave twinge jealousy
keep eye two
chapter met council inside large meeting room located within town hall
walls festooned orange black signs cryptic arrows ancient words written
long table five men sat
center seat occupied thin man long black hair peppered gray
either side sat companions looked little interest
except member far left watched carefully though expecting worst
pudgy face white hair fat stomach bulged table
man sitting middle motioned forward
ibam elected leader council said
voice flat without emotion
closer examination man showed lined face caused much worry long nose cold gray eyes
gave little bow
name mikel
companion suvan

ibam smiled fellow council member moment

tried send spies little difficult find unless know way
lucky vinc found
able soldier

finally finished telling story ibam leaned back chair nodded
bad kalam sent valley
last journeyed still mostly free accursed mutans
things changed since
believe tahn called father mutans trouble future
shrug shoulders
know
seems control know intentions
ibam said see
mutans used scrape existence ruins actively harassing traders even making raids nearby lands
even felt presence since traverse wasteland get food necessary keep alive
danger yet resources combat

suvan asked finally speaking first time
ibam smiled graciously
action note managed reach
thank
plan start slowly take countryside eventually getting populace side
army large enough battle mujadeen mutans
suvan replied coolly ive traveled many places father
dont recall seeing single place controlled
started members council murmur protest
man called lydon nodded
rate going never army large enough battle either
another smile found condescending ibam said mujadeen many
far lands across wasteland
agents place march time side
mujadeen grow weaker passing year
crumble
happens step make move
lydon jumped feet said discussed many times ibam
continue wait year year stop senseless battle mujadeen
continue live like rats cowering mountains waiting day may never come
make peace mujadeen trade even affect political process
sure warlord reasonable man
mutans real danger
deal first
fool ibam responded angrily
give away everything ancestors worked
barely survived struggling survive mountains
hard work intelligence today
want future children slavery tyrant even people
go interrupted speech asked please tell message tai says
ibam let breath staring hard lydon
moment hesitation finally said course mikel right messenger
tai sent investigate certain recent reports heard concerning mujadeen
rumored digging deep sand looking weapons ancients
far searches fruitless

mujadeen found old missile silo
according note silo intact unfired missile
felt confused words
mean
time vinc spoke words harsh
traveled wasteland
saw damage done ancients long ago
believe note tai mujadeen found weapon
no reason use
stared disbelief
surely weapon last years
seen eyes damage done time city remnants within
theres nothing rust dust
vinc said true ancients able protect important weapons harm
missiles buried deep ground went great lengths keep free elements
entirely possible weapon still launched
never dare lydon added without asked
ibam made known
said vinc said true need send someone investigate need put stop
stared said last words
surely dont mean
asked surprise
barely made alive want send wasteland
ibam replied seen
need someone familiar area around ewark
afraid kalam getting old activity
anyway want place community must help
blackmail suvan angrily interjected
call want afford leave
dont worry mikel shall vinc go along
bring dozen men
make sure protected
lydon strode room without saying word
chapter night returned hospital sleep
settling doctor stopped checked condition confirming good enough health travel
left shut lights went bed
instead sleeping pondered events day
though disagreed lydon council issues raised one point rising danger mutans must dealt mujadeen
also no mood return ewark even future depended
fair suffer much put life line
even thoughts nothing compared jealousy felt
possible suvan fall love pig headed vinc
tumultuous thoughts eventually gave away uneasy sleep
awoke
eyes greeted darkness found move
shout somebody held arms someone else affixed gag mouth
tried struggle using legs kick away blanket late since held many hands
nothing stop
body physically dragged hospital
dimness moonlight sky see four dressed dark colored robes hid faces view
thrown face waiting cart
cart pulled pushed along hand distance forcibly removed
small house windows dark lifeless
one abductors knocked door hurriedly opened
brought inside dark forced sit chair quickly tied
gag removed

spat
one moment disembodied voice answered
snap overhead electrical light turned
blinked several times
took moment recognize lydon
behind stood four men
dressed black robes reminded man followed city
asked impatiently brought
wherever
smiled benignly
whatever takes stop fool plan ibam
surely go without
countered
know important
know ibam like
spend much time fruitlessly searching thinking dont want live part bargain
give time friend return ewark
man standing closest lydon stepped forward
threw back hood reveal
surprise hussen man betrayed tai mujadeen

say
hussen laughed triumphantly
see mikel trick along
sub vizier decided let rescued fool brewer kalam
knew along
let come providing exact whereabouts rebel city
stopped desert patrol killing
saved mutan arrow
led luckily fall lydon men
told sub vizier willing make treaty interested say
rasid pleased return ewark tell good news
rebellion finally broken warlord sure award
looked lydon see reacted information
merely nodded already knew
said lydon truce mujadeen really think hussen help account
replied laugh
given certain guarantees
no harm come people provided give
better solution endless war waging countless years
finally peace instead concentrate mutan threat
better hussen agreed half hidden sneer
couldnt believe hearing
trust hussen
trust rasid
care anyone
lydon merely said agreement already made
talk
hussen said must going
sure pleasant time guest
bad never meet
shook hands lydon left front door
slowly shook head
said letting go doomed everyone
mujadeen come enslave everyone
maybe lydon replied
afterward made ruler town
no council ibam telling
eyes shone unnatural light found discomforting
man lusted power safety rebels
ranting part interrupted knock door
lydon froze face frozen shock
drew sword side
three
open
someone shouted outside
recognized voice vinc
sudden crack door burst open
rushed vinc several men
captors dropped weapons wanting fight best troops town
see man leave
asked hopefully
saw no one leave vinc replied shake head
gotten
suvan went check found missing
lydon obvious kidnapper visiting house finding empty came home brother
please hurt lydon pleaded strong voice reduced fear soaked tremor
council decide vinc replied without pity
chapter left next day using steep path went valley
horses kept fenced paddock
sorted packed stores mounted left safety rebel stronghold
rode back pack next suvan vinc soldiers rode ahead
hate say foul mood barely spoke suvan
took silence stride instead seemed rather taken new excursion
perhaps adventurous preferred quiet life
still smarting way treated council
lost way living taken great risks deliver tai message
recent troubles hussen lydon unfair given new task
also tired still recovering wounds received
still require go dangerous journey
wasteland looked glad horseback time
plan try catch hussen reach ewark
barring proceed silo try stop missile used
cover night hussen managed escape town unscathed
tracks discovered vincs men showing spy riding straight east across desert
follow quickly using extra water rations brought two pack horses
cat got tongue
suvan asked breaking spell thoughts
waved hand sand around
ready yet admitted
smiled kindly
no one ever truly ready life
best
watching awfully good job far
kind words brightened mood
thank say
wished said didnt know heart lay
squinted looking distant horizon
first met doubted good anything
proved wrong time time
fought suffered saved life several occasions
even willing sacrifice save
took bravery
feel brave
think anyone ever said staring
suppose matter whether run away
never ran
help blush
felt quaver voice asked tell interest vinc
laughed sound like silvery bells
whatever gave idea
know
perhaps way looks
tell interested
course grateful saving lives
also showed around town glad company
brilliant man way
see commented dryly
jealous
playfully asked
think right feel way retorted
mood suddenly changing suvan glared distaste
perhaps let go head
woman kept like horse favorite pet
decide life
shook head
say ever met woman like
met many women
different
learn perhaps talk
felt face flush anger
instead replying took drink canteen stared straight ahead
fell back silence hardly speaking word suvan anyone else stopped night
vinc never shown much interest trip stopped bedroll
men suvan sitting around smoldering fire decided go sleep
top nearest dune sat guard watch slept
join
vinc asked features shadowed darkness
shrugged
tonight prefer alone
see said even though tell tone voice
said look appreciate help crossing wasteland
never properly thanked saving life either
done twice
dead still need watching every moment life
no bother said dryly
sake suvan seems care
even make effort
stared
care thinks
life soldier lonely one
patrolled desert life fighting mutans keeping land safe mujadeen
never time women given much thought
saw suvan first time heart changed forever
worship strength tell
exactly telling
asked wondering soldier suffer shyness
sighed plaintively
two crossed wasteland together
also spent much time together fighting survival
like know stand
nothing said coldly wanting answer question
good said tone becoming brighter ever heard
free pursue
mind
go ahead replied hating glib
still angry suvan
wanted forget still felt flash hot jealousy vinc words
good
vinc exclaimed
clapped shoulder proudly stepped back join others adding bright laughter around campfire
cheerfulness made mood worse
slipped inside bedroll covered head
seemed like forever camp quieted
terrible thoughts jealousy anger filled head
took quite time finally fell asleep
chapter traveled
two days later came across wide furrow desert floor covered hussen tracks
traveled well past valley new sight strange
closer examination soft sand showed made hundreds marching mutan feet
move heading straight east towards ewark
vinc commanded turn side fearing catch mighty host
also meant stop pursuit hussen
day later reached edges ewark
time food supply low water left wasnt good either
part looking forward back ewark hated idea seeing burned remains hotel
thoughts tossed aside saw smoke horizon
heart sank stomach

heard saying
mutans vinc answered
tracks saw day headed towards town
war
shook head
mutans never attacked ewark
protected mujadeen
vinc replied mutans never moved numbers
take men horseback stop mighty army
sent three men gallop ahead
suvan looked visibly shaken group rode
remained silent fearful lay ahead
approached city see smoldering remnants buildings
nothing left standing even minarets mosque
found ironic rest ewark met fate hotel
cluttering streets countless remains bodies human mutan picked circling crows
sound heard flapping wings heat air
viewed destruction felt sick helplessness
somehow felt done something stop terrible bloodshed
sorry heard suvan say
riding next eyes wide fear
words exchanged since last conversation
nothing sorry said crossly
still angry embers words cooled since
hotel located
pointed crumbled walls
appeared fire destroyed inside entire building collapsed
nothing left pile blackened bricks
hard think everything owned reduced ashes
perhaps fitting tomb molli
wanted stay hotel end days beyond
visited ewark father suvan saying
seemed like nice place
okay replied
people deserve die way
no one deserves fate
vinc nearby listening conversation
said issue mutans graver ever expected
never knew numbers grown strong
never strength pull attack magnitude
said perhaps lydon right feud mujadeen must put rest mutans destroyed
surely pressing problem ancient vendetta
vinc shook head stubbornly
battle warlord mujadeen going generations
greater evil
surprised response considering great injustice given
pointed destruction surrounding
though tyrants mujadeen never killed great scale like
vinc answer one scouts returned
face frozen mask horror talked voice cracked raw motion
sir mile distant came across site recent battle
looks mujadeen met mutans fight
area strewn dead sides
mujadeen must put good fight many evil creatures left carrion birds
sadly also many dead men
signs show mujadeen forced retreat
say
afterward mutans moved ewark see laid waste town
thank vinc said man
go rejoin men
shall leave accursed place soon
soldier left suvan said shall
nothing left vinc answered
missile silo surely overrun mutans
threat mujadeen overtaken fresh events
return council tell new tidings
scouts return shall start back
seized idea said like see kalam still alive
waste time vinc replied
either dead fled mutans arrived
still want check replied sharply
go suvan offered
face alight idea helping
perhaps feel better something feel helplessness face horror surrounded
whatever want vinc said testily
least men return
quick
respond instead wheeled horse direction kalam
took gallop feeling angry vinc heartless words
seem care people town kalam saved certain death
suvan tagging along soon found ruins kalam house
tidy home charred ruin burned front door open roof collapsed mud walls scorched black
dismounted
rushing door pushed open
inside nothing blackened remains thing left sturdy furniture fine rugs littered floor
however floor made mud still intact
wondered cellar still undamaged
entering home treaded carefully wreckage reached kitchen
wall fallen covering trapdoor went basement
suvan
called
come help
soon side
worked together cleared away heavy rubble around trapdoor
carefully opened find glint arrowhead pointing face
kalam arrow drawn back bow
saw tension bow went slack
smiled relief
praise allah
exclaimed
thought returning mutans
laughed happy see familiar face
tell old friend survive terrible calamity
came cellar viewed destruction disappointed shake gray head
first let go outside get fresh air
familiar smell basement much
went outside
kalam looked destruction disapproving frown
stared suvan asked pretty friend
suvan
saved life wasteland
pleased make acquaintance said bow
let sit shall tell happened since unwanted exit
sat hot sand listened story
days left town began problems mutans
first nothing pinpricks little raids outer areas easily repulsed mujadeen
seems enemy merely testing defenses sharif recognize possibility
became worried survival
sent wasteland fully expecting minimal problems mutans
instead sent armed camp
truly apologize error
still alive commented blandly
praise allah safeguarding harm
main mutan attack materialized mujadeen no position stop
thanks patrols warned mighty host descending ewark
people town drafted join small mujadeen army
men stayed women children travel sent north
much time pray escaped without molested enemy
army mujadeen assembled plains south
assigned thin line bowmen left flank
middle sub vizier rasid held reserve hundred swordsmen command sharif
right cavalry two hundred horses
stood nothing worry wait
air quiet sound distant thunder rumbled west
first thought coming storm horizon turned black approaching mutan horde
years never seen horrific sight
mens knees quavered fear half army run sub vizier started praying loud guidance allah
words steadied men
afterward waited little courage muster
mutans marched towards without fear without haste
arrows rained turning sky black night
line bowmen fired flank like throwing rock swarm bees
everything looked lost cavalry charged straight enemy middle
know seems mutans fear horses almost broke brave charge
many foul creatures work
soon horses brought riders killed
ferocious pace mutans struck last line swordsmen soon overwhelmed
rest ran
fled safety basement hear screaming town destroyed
finally grew quiet found trapped
waited drinking beer arrived
nodded
glad survived
know happened sub vizier
still alive
know
horseback entirely possible escaped
asked eagerly missile silo
know
left took upon continue keep eye diggings
neither stamina agility tai still managed work close enough see facility
located two hills offering natural defense attackers
even increasing incursions mutans far know facility never evacuated
still chance mujadeen possession weapon
nodded
say
battle mutans wondered
thought perhaps sub vizier actually left bulk men guard missile silo
suvan angrily interjected said sacrifice ewark something like
kalam laughed imagine strange decisions powerful make protect interest
shall tell vinc said
return mountains yet weapon destroyed
chapter hearing fresh news vinc slowly shook head disbelief looking kalam
saying mujadeen still use missile
asked skeptically
know intentions kalam answered honestly
know may sacrificed town order save accursed weapon
send someone investigate return
perhaps mutans already overrun silo possess weapon
council want sure
vinc answered place heavily guarded say examine
asking impossible small force
cut ribbons tried enter
kalam shrugged
say
supposed soldier must figure something
volunteered
one man careful slip inside anyplace provided cautious enough
got close enough see silo kalam said agreement
sure someone else agility slip silo tried
vinc stared hard weighing possibility success
tell weapon
no expert weapons ancients
replied
no one truly say missile works
anyone assess possibility still operational
devices complex sign decay certainly stop missile successfully fired
mikel
vinc asked
shrugged shoulders
business destroyed town
weapon dangerous council says must stopped costs
obvious choice since nothing left lose
another moment reflection vinc answered
go
foolish venture best know returning
want go suvan suddenly said
watching conversation without saying word
surprised finally spoke glad wanted share danger
forbid
vinc said initial surprise statement worn
safe woman venture
eyes blazing anger suvan spat tell
go mikel nothing
dangerous vinc shot back bronzed face turning red
said gladly accept assistance suvan
words aggravated vinc words filled vitriol
go ahead get killed wash hands entire matter
stalked away back stiff anger
help notice satisfaction suvan looked retreating figure nothing pure loathing
turning attention kalam said best way get silo
took stick drew map sand
finished said see two hills
rocky difficult climb
silo resides
mujadeen built two tall walls hills enclosing silo within
also barracks made mud holds soldiers workers
rasid tent nearby use
silo look like
kalam laughed
nothing like corn silo
vantage point one hills looks like low circular hole made cement looks fresh day poured
large cover top protect missile inside elements
second man sized door base cement allows access within
suvan asked saw last many soldiers
dozen mutan invasion
many mujadeen trying find place refuge last battle
asked best way
shook head
walls guarded night day gate western side
foolish try way
saw everything described vantage point northern hill
perhaps find way side night quite dangerous
glimmer idea
turned attention suvan said scaled cliffs valley help ropes
think going
better trying find foothold night
rope suvan earnestly replied
basement kalam said eyes shining excitement
tie two together long enough
chapter making way camp waited setting sun
better work dark free mutan interference
finally arrival twilight left
vinc traveled rest men rode away safer destination closer wasteland
mood improved least time rode sullen silence instead speaking
using borrowed horse kalam led little group considerable skill picking best route travel without seen
moon nothing sliver cloaking movements darkness
closer progressed silo lighter horizon became
still night reminded escape valley mutans blocked exit keeping area lit massive fires
worst fear true
reaching crest hill saw countless bonfires grouped around two high hills
mutans laying siege remnants local mujadeen
motioned others stop dismount
pulling back horse got belly crawled forward
top hill stopped watch
soon joined others
must thousands cursed creatures said watched flickering flames
aye vinc said
never imagined force
must give foolish errand return council
suvan keeping distance vinc said sure reach one hills really tried
mutan interest seems centered around walls
think mikel
throwing life away vinc said
tone almost pleading
really deeply love suvan
blame
try said little conviction
really looking forward taking risk want vinc proven right either
missile powerful claimed necessary destroy used
hellish device already caused enough damage
ancients control impulses destruction hope
let get going suvan said impatiently
without word slid hill disappeared gloom
joining first pulled lengths rope horse
friendly handshake kalam glare vinc clambered slope hill
bottom found suvan waiting
vinc bore whispered ear
sorry
kissed lightly cheek walking away
even though face death felt happier ever felt
also felt like fool falling love woman
mischievous clever completely unpredictable anything
ran catch suvan took arm
soon holding hands making feel younger years
treading carefully heads held low came first line bonfires without enemy seeing
apparently mutans no watch patrols guard attack
since already destroyed local mujadeen army perhaps felt secure numbers
nothing left fear
vantage point see sleeping mutans dark bodies huddled together around blazing fires
still no time incautious take one mistake killed
pushing aside fear went
went tighter suvan clasp became
quake hand tell feeling frightened
chill desert night seemed even colder causing neck prickle unease
went every fire passed yet another bridge cross
reached halfway point number mutans increased dramatically
practically littering ground sleeping ever present muttering twitching suffering terrible nightmare
evil smell thick air making nostrils recoil disgust
point suvan grip like vice nails biting hard palm hand
moved cautiously ever stepping quietly gently sleeping mutans
every step torture knowing take one little mistake awaken wrath terrible creatures
circumstances time way moving glacial crawl
normal minute fleeting thing every second like molasses
seemed like hours finally reached last ring bonfires
mutans thickest
hardly anywhere step ground nearly solid black shadows thrown reposed bodies malicious beasts
suvan still found place step guiding dangerous maze breathing mutans
intent progress nearly missed movement left
suddenly stopped causing suvan almost lose grip hand
around blazing fire fifty yards away ring sleeping mutans bodies forming protective wall
inside wall evil flesh little white tent human pacing back forth deep thought
tahn
soon suvan saw looking let choked gasp
even though still surprised
made sense tahn oversee march army mutations see city still came shock senses
intuition correct tahn creator foul beasts like general leading humanity
worse crime anything mujadeen ever done

suddenly remembered message carrying read knocked foul drug
missile
suvans hand dropped mine
straddling mutan already notched arrow bow
dont
whispered urgently
get shot back
miss dont kill right away hell chance give alarm
wont chance warned hoping keep natural impulsiveness control
hushed words still werent quite enough
mutan feet rolled side back resting suvan calf
hesitation slowly slid arrow back quiver
letting sigh relief glanced tahn wishing somehow extinguish life
without mutans no direction force
no choice break apart return warrens city wasteland
kill also end life
shake head returned attention making way hill beyond
chapter kalam called hill really stony butte impossible climb given superficial examination
according kalam naturally formed impressions used clambering steep surface
left side hill found way
moments started climb high ground light dawn began breaking horizon
fires ringing mujadeen fort beginning die
see mutans beginning wake
reached top hill look mujadeen camp
line dozen soldiers armed bow swords stationed walls attention solely turned mutans
paddock contained horses low mud building took barracks single tent belong rasid
noticeable thing massive hole centered right middle camp
site excavation
nestled inside large concrete structure sunken round metallic covering least thirty feet diameter
site missile silo weapon ancients resided
coming far felt strangely elated
trouble experienced end finally sight
suvan watched glanced behind
mutans awake quickly lining stacked formations facing camp walls
shout went near tahns tent rest mutans joined frightful chorus
moment later arrows flying fast thick encircled camp
mujadeen soldiers nothing hide behind walls hail arrows fell inside
several horses hit sending running circles wild eyed panic
chance told suvan
guards inside busy pay attention
nodded jaw set determination
taking rope shoulder tied one end outcropping let side drop ground
moment climbing using feet brace side rock
moved quickly
arrows flew nothing close enough cause concern
made ground quickly followed suit
rope felt rough hands burning palms fingers rappelled
moments frantic motion feet planted desert floor
darted suvan hiding behind dirt piling leftover silo excavation
hiding spot watched
scene inside camp pure chaos
arrows flew several mujadeen soldiers running back forth no order discipline
front heard new sound metal striking metal
heard cry gates
gates
repeated several times response lackluster
suvan clutched hand breathing hard fast
perhaps stayed vinc said
shot baleful stare
rather die
leaned kissed mouth
whispered worry get somehow
made terrible city together another chance certain death
laugh kissed back
let go
said brightly
took running towards pit excavation
went past soldiers busy pay attention
engrossed dodging hail arrows dealing pounding front gate bother
jump inside excavation clambering towards metal door embedded side concrete embankment
suvan first reach turned handle door budge
soon added strength no avail
locked tight
another way
suvan asked casting worried glance shoulder
shook head
think go check
worry right back
made hasty reconnaissance around concrete structure find egress
returned suvan saw expression no way
get
asked voice rising panic rasid must locked said trying control fear
safest place right
mind suvan said shudder another barrage arrows went flying striking ground near
past feeling elation passed
going die trapped mutans broke wall
escape try gain height hill no longer cover darkness
mutans easily see progress hill trapped sides
ground underneath feet began tremble
shriek metal sliding metal rattled air
sound coming heads
quickly ran side pit look top concrete structure
immediately saw silo opening exposing wide black hole within
suvan
cried ran back
top silo opening
let push
grabbing waist hoisted top concrete
gained footing turned around took hand leaned back allowing gain foothold
soon staring dark recesses
dark gleam metal pointed upwards
missile cone shiny metal disappeared darkness
noticed metal ladder mounted side wall
pointing said suvan way
chapter took lead climbing ladder
clambered great shout heard outside
shout soon became wail panic
sound surmised gate broken allowing mutan host inside
thought made move faster since take minutes enemy brush aside remaining mujadeen soldiers
attention turned silo meaning trapped inside
light coming became less step gloom
missile nearly touching backs metallic obelisk past minutely vibrating unknown power
wished time investigate object leisure events moving quickly
relief finally touched bottom
waited suvan looked opening
pale light blue sky distant disk
smell dust dim surroundings looked free decay
really wondered relic really operational
surely complicated piece machinery last years without kind critical piece malfunctioning
know technology
suvan joined silo floor began searching walls way pit
darkness collection machinery piping attached walls made difficult
give hope row red lights ringed base floor lit
somewhere beyond walls high pitched bell started ring
glow new unexpected light enough suvan locate small closed hatch
twist lever open
inside bright unnatural light
without hint caution suvan immediately crawled
went glanced one time sky
little surprise saw face tahn several mutans looking
another moment slipped opening hoping find way escape trap alive
found knees well lit hallway
stand motion cut unexpected words rasid
well isnt old friend mikel
standing suvan arm around neck pistol pointed head
though may think otherwise glad see still alive
knows much longer
allow stand
staring hatred
also saw suvans eyes wide fear lips slightly parted speak
said impatiently mutans close behind
wont take long figure get
rasid laughed
time friend late stop
move
pushed suvan roughly forward made pretense meekly following
nothing gain death rushed even went pistol hidden shirt
rasid followed gun trained back
went hallway white tiled floor thick dust recently trampled many boots
end passage another metal door rasid motioned suvan open
waved gun motioning go
suvan went first followed
sight greeted inside beyond anything ever seen
around low long desk sat three men plastic chairs
one hussen stopped work give malicious grin
concentration lit panels front
unfathomable mess words symbols chaotic movement make little sense
rest room painted flat gray except far wall dominated larger lit panel showed map symbols
rasid saw confusion said thats something called display
told
computer electronic machine used targeting missile
ive told quite accurate power particular missile doesnt direct hit
suvans fear gave away curiosity
electricity asked come
rasid replied ive told theres small power plant buried underneath
technicians told enough energy run place another hundred years
simply amazing isnt
ancients truly masters craft
bad never got chance see particular missile used
sure pleased see still work years
replied suspiciously said something targeting
dark eyes shined excitement
astute mikel
always thought smart likes ewark
see given order warlord finally put end rebels
thanks hussen ive tracked location
power council mayfly completely ineffectual
still continue defy warlord glorious power
reason enough
use ancient weapon finally put matter rest
going destroy push button
looked rasid like madman
perhaps
mutans
surely threat rebels
look ewark destroying army process
free hand gave dismissive wave
ewark doesnt matter grand scheme things
rebels killed mutans easy enough destroy
warlord army see

shouted
thousands mutans city
ive seen beat battle
overrun destroy every last city nothing left humanity
rasid stared blankly ignoring pleas
hussen stood desk
turned bowed sub vizier
said everything ready master

rasid asked
told technicians instructions quite clear sir
coordinates entered takes word fire missile
proper codes entered fire button ready push
never mind
fire rasid said voice cold ice
command hussen answered
talking slipped gun shirt
since rasid busy addressing man see movement late
stretched arm fired gun striking rasid point blank chest
eyes went wide shock blood began seeping wound
hand held gun went slack slid floor eyelids fluttering
let single groan silent still
suvan merely stared perhaps forgetting still carried pistol
hussen looked wide eyed expression one dismay
said angrily want get
take two leave
mutans
trapped pleaded
guess youll take chance like leave
well gulped
wave pistol two men left desk quickly exited together door
take rasids gun ordered suvan
quickly complied pulling pistol clasp
looked interest smiled
murderous brute want
let hussen go
choice
disarm weapon someone else figures use
rather hussen instead taking chance firing missile
anyway need save bullets mutans try make escape
destroy computer suvan suggested
good let get started
chance sudden scream
ducked head door saw hussen come running back direction
chased pack mutans
two men slow already lying floor dead
covered blood
hussen quickly cut slashes blade
behind foul creatures stood tahn
shut door wishing lock

suvan whispered looking screens front

going
felt heft pistol hand
chances going die
reached grabbed hand
let die together
took step towards kissed mouth
overhead light suddenly went replaced flashing red strobe
turned saw rasid hunkered desk hands control panels
turned gave one last leer slumped ground
running grabbed front tunic began shake


shouted
late answers since rasid finally dead
ground beneath feet began tremble
red light began swirl faster rate ringing bell started ring louder
meanwhile suvan rushed desk began randomly push buttons
moment door burst open
mutans rushed room swords held high air
chapter fired
first bullet struck lead mutan sending sprawling backwards
next bullet tore rushing mass tripped comrade
soon joined suvan began clumsily firing rasids pistol
barrage bullets slowed foul creatures nothing stop aggressive nature
kept coming glad chance strike human
kept firing pistol hammer fell empty cylinder
ammunition
throwing aside worthless pistol drew sword waited impatiently suvan finish shooting
knowing going die soon feel heart hammering inside chest
second later suvan threw gun draw bow
took chance started slashing mutans like man possessed
fire guns already made pile fresh corpses making floor slippery black blood
parried slashed jabbed blade suvan fired arrow arrow horde beasts
though actions valiant little stop tide
tremors ground gave away mighty roar practically shook feet
fought stand mutans
surprise turned started run away panic
unfamiliar sound motion firing missile somehow scared enough flee
within moments suddenly free attack
open door see tahn trying stop remaining mutans retreating
entreaties ignored soon living creature left hallway
overpowering sound missile launch ceased leaving nothing silence
looking littered remains slaves tahns eyes locked onto mine
scowled stepped sword ready

exclaimed eyes lit madness missile
came way get missile
mean old man
back city read note carrying
told great weapon hidden away
mine
came sons take mine
gone fool
shouted
creatures left said hefted sword hand
suggest late
ill never understand madness overtook tahn expression turned one pure rage lips curled hate eyes blazed passion
rushed fumbling object hanging waist
dagger brought high head
maddening scream tried plunge chest
tahn slow
dodged blow grabbed neck threw hard wall
head hit horrific crack tahn fell ground like rag doll
way neck bent knew dead

suvan whispered behind
yes
lets get replied sourly
went hallway opened door end
climbed metal stairs reached door already forced open
climbed pit silence ignoring dead bodies strewn within
camp devoid life things left broken arrows corpses
looked sky eyes following white cloudy trail missile

walked along empty road alone occasionally waving passing kids bikes
backpack slung shoulder filled writing books sketchpads
kept eyes shadowed road watching every step
usually aware surroundings today tired didnt care rammed tree
kicked rock grass
sun starting set painting sky brilliant oranges reds
slipped sky allowing first stars peek behind bright curtain
remaining light cast shadows everything creating illusion double everything
world prepared go hours unreal silence made seem magical really
phone buzzed awoke trance

flipped open pad wrote walking home
shoved back pocket continued walking

gripped bow hard afraid might break two
heard screechy laughter

bible staying
purple bolivia pastor martir mentioned quechua bible conference ways bolivian countryside certainly kidding
calculations eight hours gone since left vibrant garden city cochabamba climbing higher higher clouds
wara cadogan slit eyes open squinted around darkened interior jeep
windowpanes frosted sun hid behind jagged peaks andes
elbow jabbed side wara heard friend nazaret martir yawn squeaky muffled sound caused father pastor martir glance girls rearview mirror
second told much chipper cooped jeep day
know freezing soon get warmed
long hike
wara stuffed numb hands sleeves alpaca sweater bit lip
let talked
loved martirs large family basically adopted wara six years missionary bolivia
linguistics major wara usually jumped chance travel countryside practice speaking quechua
pastor martir said needed translate spanish quechua conference potosi wara enthusiastically answered
bad idea
bad idea
bible conference wara
thinking
pastor martir steered jeep cavernous rut wara felt jaw snap impact
turquoise knit cap wore slid one eye
pushed hat back position low moan came back seat
stressed wara grinned
best guy friend noah waking perch back luggage

heard mutter breath
place looks like twilight zone
one long arm brushed wara ear reached clear frost window
single light outside murky sky tossed thick shadows
skeletal remains tree rose gravel path beckoning jeep forward
noah right looked downright freaky
pushing back nervousness whole bible conference thing wara turned towards back seat
despite rough ride noah looking content emerald green eyes glinting moonlight
sandy shoulder length hair littered straw poor guy really hunch fit frame tight space top luggage
first glance noah hearst might give aura surfer dude really full muscle
fat
noah big guy
plus really lot surfers ohio noah
nice nap back potatoes
asked
noah tried stretch grimaced gave
yeah
guess
glanced around car took pastor martir two skinny quechua speaking bible school students front wara nazaret middle seat
guess one carrying stuff conference lunch
seriously good
nazaret dad must thrilled got translate though
word street speak quechua like native
true
despite cold wara felt armpits prick
used good
first year wara lived bolivia worked teaching bible lessons ladies quechua helped ton children bible clubs around city
everything happened
left country four months try get things together came back teaching literacy classes quechua women
volunteering home children aids martir family ran
teach bible anymore make hypocrite
noah good friend never asked
never get lucky noah going
sounding bolivian looking
imagine anyone ever mixing bolivian
no
wara raised eyebrow stifled smile
seriously worried anybody thought bolivian
addition tall blond skin crisped red strong cochabamba sun noah studied spanish spain
whenever guy spoke spanish came lisp bolivians sounded really silly
noah good reason jealous wara
besides teaching quechua time baby wara quechua grandmother peru passed along color
wara skin light tan bronzed sun
behind trendy maroon glasses eyes honey brown
brown hair sporting uneven cut burgundy highlights let fit right bolivian friends
think getting cold nazaret announced smally wara side
wara turned back took friend pale heart shaped face framed dyed blond ringlets
sheathed puffy pink coat mounds pink scarves snow white knit hat pale pink sparkles
jeep hit another hard rut nazaret sneezed cute shrill little sound muffled tiny pink alpaca mittens
hov still help wif kids sniffled bleary hazel eyes turned noah patted white knit cap encouraging words
jerked attention jeep braked halt sudden spray gravel
group piled car discovered air outside car even colder inside
even though look ridiculous wara almost wished wearing snow pants like little growing montana
frayed jeans hippie tunic alpaca sweater anything keep warm
frozen fingers brushed lazily cheeks hulking mountains around
distance something howled
nazaret covered nose one mitten muffle another sharp sneeze echoed mountains night
scuse
noah cheerfully pushed past wara carting gigantic burlap sack potatoes
coming nazaret father followed hauling second bag something edible
wara huddled next nazaret minute watching guys hefted food sleeping bags onto haggle scrawny burros
quechua guys black jackets slacks materialized adobe hut helping arrange everything donkeys light shimmering bonfire
pastor martir came every year preach rural bible conference potosi said best climb mountain night cooler
right wara really hoped knew talking
still seven hour hike ahead forested granite
stifled heavy yawn fixed gaze diamond stars
morning woke scruffy feathers beak
chicken scratched pebbles right outside crumbling adobe wall community school house others crashed hours hike
local christians gone trouble fixing wooden pallets woolen blankets school guests private place stay
wara knew gone lot trouble hated admit honestly worth going sleep
well organized army fleas taken residence wool blankets long noah nazaret scratched grumbled hours pastor martir coated beds raid
maybe daylight streaming holes schoolhouse wall darn hard move
overdose raid
wara kicked sleeping bag grabbed glasses dirt floor pulled sitting
pastor martir already gone probably outside morning prayer vigil quechua christians
nazaret curled plank bed still snoring
noah long legs stuck end unzipped sleeping bag leaving filthy socked feet sprawled dirt near giant maroon nike tennis shoes
moved stand powdery remains dried fleas shifted navy fleece sleeping bag
eeww
wara grin sight dried bugs
really loved kind trips
dusted bare feet edge jeans stuffed sockless feet doc marten boots hoping find someplace outside use bathroom everyone else got
waist high cluster boulders overlooking valley turned best option privacy
brushed teeth water dented bottle pura vida spit deserted valley
trailing wisps clouds slithered around boulders
structures visible schoolhouse slept two sturdy adobe houses little way rounded path
quechua lady huge smile waiting school breakfast sweet purple corn drink boiled eggs
wore knee length circle skirt called pollera one soft sage green
despite morning chill mahogany legs bare wore scuffed black plastic ballet flats
warm cardigan lacy white blouse quechua ladies always wore
lady bringing breakfast introduced doa petronia patted wara forearm greeting telling happy god brought wara conference
wara smiled back wanly even though lot fun speaking quechua mountains
still feel good idea part bible conference acting like sweet good pastor martir noah bible school students
felt like fake
still queasy mumbled something appropriate tried get purple api egg
assigned help noah charge kids parents attended bible classes
wara already seen action many times five years friends teaching bible stories kids martirs aids center hanging little homeless kid downtown cochabamba
within minutes noah group kids sitting grassy knoll captivated bible songs actions
made wara come stand next translate story quechua one jesus calming stormy sea
grew church rattle story heart english spanish quechua
no way keep group kids glued every word way noah
ignored sick feeling stomach stood next noah feeling little insignificant five foot five next six foot three
tell noah story kids quechua
failings ruin moment kids
noah deserved listened
story see kids eyes imagined every peal thunder felt shuddering splintered wooden boat open sea
noah asked kids come stand side one one tell afraid
enough eat hail destroys crops mumbled one almond eyed little boy jade chullu cap
afraid terrible goat lives hill
several muffled giggles scattered across group
thunder storms
one short boy tattered soccer jersey trudged front turn recited gravely scared brothers become one missing like brother antonio
wara scrunched face
never heard anyone refer someone died missing quechua maybe regional idiom
going ask around later figure really phrase used
nerd
blinked away thoughts quechua grammar brought attention back noah beaming children waiting translate
know little told kids dog lived houses away mine really really big teeth
suddenly strangely noah slung arm wara shoulders leaving two facing children together
want know kids jesus scared anything
stronger anything world
mesmerized noah words kids wara felt leaning side
lesson
thanks translating noah told dropped arm smiled
wara felt heart weird pitter patter stared jogged chase kids game tag
attraction feeling
chided warily
noah friend
never think noah anything friend
right
wara blinked squinted noah grabbing giggling little kid around shoulders swinging air
crazy let think noah anything friend
much goofy anything else
wara always studying sometimes really grouchy
noah always happy go lucky watched way many cartoons
exactly prince charming
plus really know
wara shook back reality headed back towards house thinking probably help ladies fix lunch
cloud covered valley writhed mist licking emerald grass feet
hauntingly beautiful
rocky dirt outside main house found circle quechua women squatting wide velvet pollera skirts around plastic tub potatoes
ladies skillfully attacked miniscule purple yellow veined potatoes paring knives leaving spuds without peel seconds
wara hunkered next smiling lady breakfast morning doa petronia
wara tried hard learn peel potatoes like respectable quechua woman usually ended desecrating potato scraping half scrap pile
fiddled around little knife bumpy yellow potato decided put grammar question
wondering something one kids said
say family member missing mean person died
doa petronia long blade faltered mid peel reached one work roughed hand flip braid behind back
everyone fell silent
must heard son edgar talking finally nodded
six worried older brother
maybe juan marco talking older brother interjected portly woman royal purple pollera
thick layer fat rolled waist skirt blanketed silky white undershirt ladies wore short lace blouses
jerked chin towards doa petronia
older sons teenagers
three months ago boys went away never heard
went away
wara frowned
call missing
doa petronia looked wara directly eye
boys went llallagua sell potatoes completely different days
never heard
know gone
call boys missing
boys
two women eyed soberly
mountains many different communities
missing
wara know say
women sons boys communities gone
pain women black eyes evident wara felt horrible
many people bible conference son brother disappeared
really glad nazaret still teaching somewhere
hope already heard
martirs busy household six kids upon time seven
wara knew nazaret older brother run away teenager knew serious skinny oldest martir faded photograph frame nazaret dresser
talking missing kids always enough start nazaret weeping
wara really hoped friend hear
make think brother missing boy probably never going come home
identify little kid picture sometimes thought much things wara wanted run away start
except past always follows
noah running hill panting hundred screaming quechua kids close heels
even wanted noah never deserve
things even time erase

alejo irritated
know personally hated salazar much
another scumbag offed
except stalin absolutely know thing decision alejo trying make
roads outside peshawar cut dry dusty mountain faces incredibly sheer drop offs framed narrow edges
eventually hummer left peaks jolted across stony field rutted tracks barely visible weak light dawn
everywhere mud brick houses sprung rocky dust shattered missiles empty shells family life must filled
small children sometimes lined road staring huge kohl lined eyes impressive hummer roared past clouding ragged bodies billows thick dust
sometime around noon armored hummer arrived run village consisting cluster houses around stone well
mangy skeletal donkeys wandered tethered fraying ropes
scrawny chickens free range dusty central courtyard
baby cried franticly inside one single room homes
piece burlap hung small window stirred dark form peered baby immediately hushed
somewhere near distance dull echo missile launcher pounded surrounding mountains
alejo started realized near current battle zone
cool hiss metallic doors hummer unlocked opened
mateen took long drink two liter bottle luke warm coca cola
pashtun guards leapt car weapons gripped tightly rough hands
settle settle khan barked pashto appearing amused
nothing afraid right village

alejo leather sandals sucked mud followed ishmael
thin plume smoke snaked chimney building slate gray sky
alejo halted impatiently outside splintered wooden door khan called building pashto curt answer came back khan motioned happily alejo open door
features impassive alejo pushed way cautiously darkened building found less expected room tightly packed mud caked exhausted mujahedeen taking early morning snooze fire heading fight enemy combatants
wore grimy shalwar kameezs traditional pashtun hats ring around bottom bulging like wool muffin top
men looked thin fed much young
many body parts wrapped dirt encrusted ratty bandages mottled dried blood
around one hundred pairs brown battle weary eyes stared back alejo vision adjusted dim lighting
felt khan push past forcing inside room
well come see surprise
alejo confused let show cocking eyebrow ishmael
interested radical fighters petty battles slight differences religion generational blood feuds

asalaam alaikum
ishmael greeted men enthusiastically obviously knowing made effort sit straighter respect returned pashto greeting

khan motioned widely towards alejo pleased kindergartner presenting newest coloring page favorite teacher

gabriel brain cartwheels time stopped bite eat one horse town along road back peshawar
absolutely everyone along village single road stopped gawk mateen pulled black hummer next ditch raw sewage ducked khan village eating establishment
bodyguards talking loudly show alejo lost world ever since left tribal area
got like sometimes
gabriel found left alone come funk knew
tried catch alejo eye smile entered restaurant
grimy aquamarine walls dominated small eating place shocking color cheap plastic mats spread across floor
several groups men already eating lunch one leg folded support right arm bent cross legged woven mat
right hand pashtun men scooped cooked spinach torn pieces oven roasted naan bread
along one wall lay scattered pile black plastic sandals varying states muddiness
several men blackened bare feet twitched inches away food
bon apetit
digging gabriel slipped cell phone one pocket check time
yep
time prayers
around twenty men room began unroll tattered prayer mats special corner restaurant working one man spread rows middle uneven concrete floor facing mecca
town mosque must near judging volume haunting call prayer suddenly cut air loudspeaker
customers already lunch simply pray together
small spigot water outside door concrete courtyard provided place men perform wudu ritual washing prayers
gabriel waited turn trickle water began focus mind allah washed parts required prophet
alejo took gabriel place faucet began washing quiet morose
gabriel bare wet feet made sucking sound padded back inside across muddy concrete large moist footprints mingling others create mosaic darkened patches restaurant floor
frigid rivulets water formed crystal drops like sweat gabriel face wet spiky hair chin
kneeling next alejo gabriel prostrated mat began pray one alone reward eternal life
wait another week gabriel finally got time
rest team flown back bolivia day legendary trip tribal area one gabriel dreams ambrin began come true

huge pashtun guard clad cotton candy pink shalwar kameez muscles bulging mateen shirt convinced gabriel color somehow make man look less respectable
khan sent tell pick eight little good bye dinner mateen announced
smile twitched mateen bushy black beard bowed deferentially glided back towards silver bmw idling outside door
mean ten gabriel raised eyebrow departing guard
people accused bolivians always tardy everything really no idea
pakistanis beat
seeing beard reminded gabriel pathetic attempt grow beard order good muslim
inches reddish peachy fuzz dusting chin least showed made effort pious
never able wear pink shalwar kameez like mateen gabriel thought
door apartment pounded shut sighed left alone
shiny distorted image glimmered back mirror golden wardrobe opposite wall gabriel scowled measly beard pack
got pack
maybe settle watch sermon one mullahs
trusty hiker backpack propped next bed gabriel opened huge gold wardrobe pulled stack folded shalwar kameezs sweaters jeans
babies
first carefully lifted favorite quran inside black leather quran case position respect highest table room gently placed inside backpack
came hard shelled black case bed
gabriel fondly clicked case open revealing smooth honey wood violin
guy since parents given sixteenth birthday violin always came gabriel anywhere went important
carefully placed small case inside backpack

violin wherever go home
left money
understood reasons sometimes really wished boss pay cash
debit cards existed reason
gabriel decided deposit cash bank one many banks close apartment account
pulled fraying gray sweater long shalwar kameez headed bank
thirty minutes later disposed cash gabriel strolled lazily one peshawar main thoroughfares thick haze ochre smog pollution
bordering sidewalk heavy buses painted like kaleidoscopes rumbled next wooden donkey carts
chorus thousand horns blared
two female shapes heavily shrouded black veils fell ground glided front gabriel began weave way across street
though modestly covered girls huge dark eyes exposed gabriel tell must young maybe age
realized thinking face began slow burn
ashamed even noticing
allah help
offered great mission unworthy
got make pure clean
please
still praying ducked past street vendor sizzling vat curry winding alleyway already shadowy approaching night
crunching sensation angst belly came moment gabriel eyes told erred let mind wander away surroundings
barely registered shadowy shapes three men suddenly surged behind peripheral vision came flash adrenaline
force bodies propelled gabriel face first coarse concrete wall
feeling true panic gabriel swore spanish
two men gripped arms tightly behind back third tore gabriel cap threw ground grabbed hair turn face toward either side

gabriel gasped pashto
maybe mistaken someone else
light skin look lot like afghani
shut
look die
yelled one men voice sounded like traffic accident
yanked gabriel head back hair exposing neck scraping nose chin painfully across pock marked wall
felt prick wicked knife pressed throat
looking
gabriel stammered hating able control tremor
alejo fight guys
something hot tangy oozed gabriel bloodied lip onto tongue
taste blood made want gag
give money got bank
demand came one men shadowy darkness back alley way
cut throat dirty afghan
gabriel swallowed hard took steadying breath
course
money right pocket
left one
money wallet
hand thrust violently left pocket gabriel long kameez causing totter knife neck bite flesh
gabriel gasped told men get money bank

one yelled twisting gabriel arm hard behind back eyes watered pain

hiding money slaughter like pig
followed bank
noticed

deposit receipt
see left deposit bank
money wallet
sweat ran gabriel face along blood
knew around two hundred rupees wallet paltry sum enough buy potato chips coke
thank god nothing wallet identify westerner usual
afghan identity card thanks khans
snarl several pashto curses told gabriel indeed thieves pleased pittance wallet rumpled slip told twenty thousand euros deposited victim left bank began follow
man holding blade gabriel throat swore violently ear
hold
rough hands dug upper arms
someone else pulled hair forcing gabriel face towards sky
knife slashed throat like sting thousand wasps eyes rolled back head
everything hazed midnight world black gabriel shara even crumpled thieves feet next graffiti covered wall
terribly strange aware world passing around yet feel immobile stone limbs heavy petrified wood
drifting awareness gabriel finally reached point realizing move lips try speak tried say help
dirty room filled ivs cots chess board little table pieces paused mid game
ivs mean doctors hospital
chess game
dead
gabriel felt heart beat slow cold
possibly kind freaky afterlife filled rusting metal cots eternal games chess
dead
gabriel attempted roll one side morbid curiosity winning sluggishness
something stabbed neck chest movement yelled suddenly remembering alley thieves knife slitting throat
saw alejo materializing strange room followed short little doctor dirty lab coat
take easy gabo alejo said hoarsely

gabriel forced relax back pillow weak relief sight friend
alejo looking cry

gabriel felt face spread grin
sad looking lopsided grin happy one nonetheless
allah chosen friend doctor patted gabriel shoulder

gabriel felt smile drain lips

allah saved miracle
gabriel knew worked

nausea filled imagined noah arm ripped away shoulder thrown fiery bus explosion tossed window opposite direction safety
know women take long time really get back
wara thought cheerful voice skinny gabriel
slogged across spiky grass bare feet scooped backpack
take back called sadly
way wished tie instead bringing back clearing
sapphire blue butterflies flitting across racing surface stream licking crystal drops dipping spindly black legs water
stalin gabriel crunched way foliage staring standing bare feet

alejo bound wrists together
barely time register fact alejo threw arm around dragged tighter chest
rib cage slammed hooked leg around back preventing escape
knew kissing scarce stubble chin like sandpaper cheek
appalled wara struggled trying free one legs kick hard
no use caught like worm hook
heavy footsteps sounded outside sunlight flooded tent someone flapped open door
alejo took time finishing kiss finally let wara draw back turn towards door
vision swam took familiar figures stalin gabriel along two new faces watching inside tent
shower sparks shot skull alejo grabbed hair tilted face upward towards
eyes glinting thousand specks green fire felt face burn absolutely humiliated
alejo winked turned towards guys door

soon little conference older guy turned beady gaze back wara
still pinned benjamin eyes barely slit open first time ever trying figure language everyone speaking

alejo pushed ahead cover mossy forest dragging wara along stomped grass
vision cleared enough make trees everything still shimmered sure alejo holding dropped ground
absently realized salty stuff dripping across lips blood nose probably broken
may nazaret never hear brother done
pushed quite ways forest ducking hanging tree fronds circling giant banana plants
wara foot hooked big root went hurdling towards forest floor
vision flashing knife waving near neck told alejo going
wara breath pumped chest sharp gasp body slammed top pushing face raspy grass
rough hand clamped across mouth sending rays pains surging though skull
scream whispered lowly ear

wool blanket covered worn striped sheets ripped back covers fell inside
forced breathing even willing sleep sleep
lying hostel room man tried kill noah
sleep bring blessed unconsciousness craved
sleep come
frayed mind whirled around single thought faster faster polishing weighty obsession
finally flipped lumpy bed face alejo still visible dim light small bedside lamp
hunched edge bed wearing gray shirt cargo pants head hands
reason thought crossed wara mind clothes nazaret brother literally left old life clothes back
frowning wara realized probably never go back get stuff wherever lived big trouble

alejo raised hands make sarcastic quotation marks air around word good lips twisting cynically
paused asked distractedly parents ever tell ruben mamani

franco salazar worked national government mayor quillacollo
medium sized town outskirts cochabamba

long pause composed voice one month later ruben ended ditch dead

barely able make face peering tinted windows sleek double decker bus depart lima peru
alejo convinced family follow plan call friend church bring clothes market food trip

silky gray rain clouds swirled across evening sky threatening downpour entire martir family boarded bus take away bolivia
nazaret sobbed hugged wara hesitated threw brother weeping chest
alejo back towards wara seen put arms around nazaret pulled away

without turning around answered carefully think
never forgive
taxi sped along highway towards sacaba route taken say good bye martirs
even halfway sacaba alejo directed taxi driver veer highway towards gravel covered incline

alejo head buzzed throat tightened turned stare cows tall white grass whizzing outside van
gabriel silent jerked steering wheel hard right veering delivery truck gravel road onto narrower dirt path thick canopy lacy trees
alejo knew pairumani country estate belonged simon patio
patio one wealthiest men world world war making fortune tin
house gardens lands retreat mansion cochabamba
farther along path low waterfall gurgled along edge road running mossy boulders
tree canopy suddenly dropped away opening breathtaking sight spacious field sapphire blue sky white fluffy stalks wild grain waving gentle breeze
towering crops two stately rows ponderous palm trees lined neat dirt road backdrop mountain peaks right ornate metal gate entrance pairumani estate
alejo raised eyebrow friend turned truck towards gate frowning unhappily
alejo visited place fields dotted various volunteer students working experimental agricultural projects sponsored patio charitable foundation

behind front yard imposing country house rose sky painted cream opaque golden trim windows framed intricate colonial plaster designs

creepy creepy words described temples dull golden statues smiling pacifically passed
mlange slippery sea creatures tacked wooden planks wicked looking nails eerie enough sort taxidermy water creatures display
fact part market meant grocery shopping given heebie jeebies
money pilfered bank account stalin bought parents three bedroom house cozy neighborhood full foreigners shiny silver lexus hired two servants clean cook fill house furniture
gotten back plane pleasant destination planning sending parents tickets come visit
old yet
spain seemed like perfect pick settle hide
warm spoke spanish rumors bathing topless
first city cordoba stalin rented nice flat seemed cosmopolitan smacked europe
excitement soon died away found lumbering gray sidewalks day day no job no steady girlfriend no friends speak
conversation alejo day coffee shop jesus kept ringing stalin ears ever since realized alejo whole jesus thing intellectual debate religion right
exact moment stalin realized alejo flinch gun head said change mind jesus god
heavy day
today stalin heart felt heavy well left massive cathedral mass bought strawberry ice cream cone vendor sidewalk
turned one ancient narrow side streets meander way general direction home
really no hurry spain no one went bed midnight moment seven
stalin took large lick sickly sweet ice cream tried clean sticky drop pink lips paper thin napkin wrapped around cone
sudden stopped eyes falling upon little sign picture white dove said libreria paz
smaller letters said libreria evangelica
christian bookstore
non catholic one
something store drew stalin towards rugged stone steps like piece lint funnel vacuum cleaner hesitated
imagined walking store browse books finding swarmed pack hunchbacked crones black dresses head coverings drag gold crowned image virgin force recite rosary born
glass door squeaked quietly little girl wearing hot pink short set skipped steps followed middle aged guy polo shirt father
go people younger eighty come store
maybe something
realizing holding breath stalin drew gust air nearly shrieked feeling cold drip melting ice cream soak fingers
hurriedly licked way around cold cone finger one one glancing around guiltily see anyone watching
finally stalin pulled together clumped stairs bookstore part praying god books worth reading explain let put jesus back mind
bell door jangled softly stalin entered relieved man behind counter waved politely turned away let customer browse shop peace
small bookstore white wooden shelves filled different titles lining walls small section music shirts
ignoring everything books stalin began one end noticing right away volumes seemed rather thin
remembering keep licking ice cream flood bookstore red carpet stalin cocked head sideways better scan titles getting disgruntled went along
one section found books titles new forty days
god control diet exercising jesus
puzzled moved next rows books saw several covers featuring blown photos people white smiles flashy clothes
god wants rich
proclaimed one book image slick hispanic man expensive purple suit
stalin brows drew together read ten day plan secure wealth plant seed grow
thin rivulet strawberry ice cream escaped side stalin cone hand splatting onto carpet
curse tip stalin tongue remembered gulped glancing man behind counter
seeing guy safely reading paying no attention stalin soiling store cussing stalin turned back books pretty confused
studied christianity depth masters phd course along religions
may exciting reading world remembered plethora thick volumes theology christian thought
books little weighty kind use weight lifting around house ever thing
kinds books
shiny books stalin saw lined around bookstore seemed anything except christianity
anything told jesus
plop
stalin stared horror mushy pink mound left top cone slid onto floor one fluid motion falling soundless whoosh onto cherry red carpet
swear albeit breath jerked head heard soft chuckle coming nearby
spiky white high heels turned long legs flowery skirt tight lilac colored jacket
front stalin stood beautiful woman ever seen saying lot
hair fell waist chestnut brown shimmers red
twinkling eyes woman regarding stalin amusement first face intuited must shade lobster beet red flattened pile melting ice cream staining carpet
hot ice cream today remarked twisted waist gracefully pull packet tissues purse
worry carpet worn no one ever notice
like scooped fallen ice cream wad tissues tossed trash standing pillar middle small room
stalin felt mouth hang open raised hand saw long perfectly manicured nails painted lilac silver
importantly saw no wedding band
shannon amazing creature said holding one perfect hand towards stalin
father always loved ireland gave irish name
accent told stalin spanish however
forced close mouth reached shake hand one sticky ones
many smooth things say flooded stalin mind moment unexpectedly seemed place middle christian bookstore surrounded surreal sound churchy music floating stereo
instead said books talk something serious
feel like self help section bookstore

shannon placed phone purse half turned towards door beginning walk
stalin took skirt legs high heels one millisecond took propel forward like dog hooked leash towards shannon daddy pastor tell jesus
end cotton candy sky tehran iran sami white hot explosion sun staggered blindfold ripped eyes brilliant glory starry spotlight adoring fans screamed name
rubber boot connected back rush light hit wide open eyes slamming pavement
rivers radiant colors stormed vision sami lifted head vaguely made city park crowds gathered absolutely silent
life lived surrounded multitudes today no one reached frenzied hands towards hope fingers briefly connect wild chords strummed electric guitar
no one rapturously snapping photos cell phone camera plotting show blurry concert images friends
sami eyes cleared enough realize encircled uniformed police bearing thick plexiglas shields synonymous riot control
formed writhing barrier crowd ominous warning anyone tried capture scene cell phone camera
still crowds stayed fixed eerily place behind police line silent
nearly ten years sami heard fans hysteric screams cheers accorded lead singer iran popular rock band ashavan
today baby blue sky sprayed cotton candy clouds last sound sami hear fans warily planted behind police park silence
today children raced slide distance ice cream man cart strolled gaping sami publicly beheaded
kneeling asphalt sami closed eyes felt watching sky spectator gruesomely comic event thirty year old literature major turned rock star sentenced beheading park list unpleasant crimes
sami knew really
something rustled behind sami snapped back reality
guard yanked cuffs around wrists checking arms secured
sami ankles also chained together often four months spent maximum security prison
get guard ordered dragging feet
slimy smudge perspiration marred young guard right eyebrow avoided prisoner eyes
obvious want

dozen feet away circled dreary ring hoary stones cement block protruded park square
murky stain began heart spreading snaking tentacles across surface block sides lifeblood spilled sun afternoon prayers past
sami stumbled bare feet barely aware sensation soles burning pavement
worn trendy italian leather shoes jeans paris cost three hundred euros
today sami feet bare bleeding
wore tattered cotton pants stained floor cell simple white shirt
shirt hung loosely frame muscles wasted away days nothing praying cell instead working elite gym club
even still towered two guards side tall broad shouldered
collective gasp rise myriad dark eyes staring park sami thought probably people gathered today barely recognized
sami mind
old sami gone different person
new sami mind standing barefoot dirty white sans ray bans without beautiful women following every move
minutes dressed pure white screaming name one made able sing first place
mon
sorry
young sweaty guard death grip sami arm named hourmazd
waiting hourmazd said reluctantly
come
sami felt feet slap across hot soiled square slow motion
next chipped concrete chopping block executioner waited crisp black uniform aviator ray bans gripping saudi arabian scimitar
attention steps behind two doctors white coats stood watching proceedings
one held dove gray tarp folded neat square wrap sami body
prison explained beheading body head carried doctors reattach two items bury sami full accordance islamic burial laws
none sami family intentions burying wayward relative christian manner
moment whether dead body laid ground facing mecca last thing sami mind
standing executioner block sami eyes blazed across gathered crowd one last time surprised see neither mother father witness gory sight
several feet behind one policemen opaque shields pale face peeped nondescript black chador veil
came
sami heart surged within stared taking last beauty ever see place called earth
met weeping eyes calmly intensely begging cry give away
see sister
time scanning solemn crowd hourmazd guard forced sami knees
hot fingers grabbed temple like vise twisting head one side plastering one cheek icy concrete
filmy coating dust pebbles settled onto block sami hand instinctively jerked forward swipe scratchy debris cheek pulled short biting metal cuffs
urgent hands still held kneeling sami realized facing crowd saw ava looking towards heaven
married
sami swallowed adam apple grazed abrasive stone
gone away germany canada together
six seven little iranian babies grown hearing jesus every day playing whatever kind music wanted
end wide hipped disheveled children get bald wrinkly
sit together fireplace every night children singing guitar loving
ream black cloth descended front sami vision cinched hard knot behind skull
blindfold pressed lashes tightly cheeks leaving blind beat heart echoing slowly darkness
pressure hands head back disappeared unearthly hush descended upon park
charges read loud list things sami never imagine becoming
rape
treason
worship satan mullah began pray loudly arabic sami waited temple icy block
prison warned moved blade miss killed first fall scimitar

mid morning changed
skies clouded brought winds plummeting temperatures light snow
no biggie right

looking low really wasnt worried keep watchful eye deteriorating conditions
shortly photo hell broke loose
skies became angry violent
temperatures hovered around zero light snow opened full blown blizzard
snows accumulated upper reaches mountain huge pockets light fluffy white stuff break loose race cliff form spindrift avalanches
aside obvious death spindrift avalanches really suck frequently pour upper face back neck
anyone every dropped ice cube back
well welcome relief pile snow
fortunately due superior intellect able recognize repetitive event caught five times
sixth dowsing snow pulled hood head
know know pure genius
isaacs plan climb simple
planned traverse cliff hundred feet point photo climb upper rock face diamond fifty feet climb onto steep snow slope
reached snow slope easy dangerous climbing summit
no problemo right
thought
admit
time making traverse diamond tired
hadnt worked conditioning well prior climb higher elevations really wearing
make matters worse didnt bring enough food water energy reserves pretty low
relief isaac led traverse hung back paid rope
felt good hang cliff bunch tiny slings instead making dangerous traverse sharp end rope called climbing
hung large block sheltered spindrift avalanches watched isaac pick way across cliff
little little alternated hands feet moved sideways relying hand footholds hold steep cliff
hanging cold winds howled
feel energy draining body minute
shivered uncontrollably shook hand knock warmth back
time seemed move slowly watched isaac cross traverse
every often isaac placed piece climbing gear rocks threaded rope
fell hed drop length past climbing gear instead feet
halfway across traverse isaac stopped
point called notch couloir
notch couloir wide break cliff ran nearly top mountain
far less steep viewing distance even considered mini valley carved top cliff
watched isaac stand like statue far front
didnt move
didnt look
didnt look around
stared straight ahead
come sally

freakin freezen remember thinking watched stand idly
world went white
enormous spindrift avalanche careened cliff face completely blocked view isaac
holy mackeral yelled didnt say mackerel

feel sickening feeling pit stomach envisioned isaac swept cliff avalanche
moment later last snowy dust floated see
isaac still standing saw last
rope gone taut due weight snow rushed
isaac swept away

saw isaac look toward notch couloir shuffle quickly across
facing mountain moved right foot right moved left foot match
isaac repeated sequence shuffling across cliff continued stare toward top
moved paid rope holding case lost footing slipped edge cliff
lifeline no idea hold weight event fall
watching cross looked full length foot cliff
high
due deteriorating conditions needed move faster place less gear route protection fall
hadnt really thought time analyze scene realized fall cliff almost certainly rip stance
felt damned scared buried fears concentrated job
moments later isaac made side snowy slope
suddenly heard loud whooosh
isaac gone
pulled hard rope locked belaying device
saw falling snow
mother spindrift avalanches creating white cloud snow rushed snowy face cliff

rush beating tempest adrenaline pumping
see scared yet invigorated

sick feeling swept
indeed turn run gauntlet
looked around futile attempt avoid inevitable finally isaac yelled back
duuude got hurry
lets go yelled deep impatience voice
quickly dismantled anchors holding mountain started way across rock snowy cliff
hand hand reached anything grab time double checking isaac taking slack
rocky face cold light dusting snow
thin polypropylene gloves great temps forties temps hovering around zero rendering gloves almost useless
fingers cold cramping reached next handhold
become increasingly worried wasnt going able hold much longer
survival instincts kicked dug deep
throwing caution wind decided make risky moves across cliff face hoping hands wouldnt fail reaching snowy slope notch couloir
moved quickly deliberately awkward lunges continually held balance
heart pumping feel anxiety building closed distance snowy slope right
minute later hands giving made final step onto snow slope fell forward rested
good job dude cross couloir heard isaac yell lay rested
dream state heard yell got time avalanches

yelled disbelief
till moment hadnt realized amount snow falling
point cliff snow increased intensity heavy savage
snowflakes large accumulating rate nearly two feet hour
much unstable snow spindrift avalanches rolling notch couloir every fifteen seconds
crossing feet wide couloir take fifteen seconds moved fast
didnt result disastrous
much snow easily sweep cliff
perfect remember saying
no sooner wisecracked watched wall snow barreling roared snow slopes narrow valley
quickly dug hands feet snow hung
watched moment impact buried head shoulders braced terrifying wave snow
first snow flowed like gentle stream water didnt last long
split second later felt full force wall snow raged top

little strength left ripped position dragged slope toward edge cliff
abruptly slide came stop snow fought push
felt wave avalanche dissipate looked investigate predicament
standing teeth clenched stood isaac

isaac ascended higher slope waited next avalanche pass
even rush dissipated started side
paid rope frozen finger plowed way deep snow
forty feet thirty feet isaac moved determination
nearly halfway mark heard scream wind

isaac caught avalanche
blizzards intensity heightened dumping even greater amounts snow onto upper regions
resultant snow created spindrift avalanched greater quantity ferocity

wave snow rolled knocking backward dragging mountain
hold hold
heard scream barely audible twenty feet
pulled hard watched desperation continued slide toward edge cliff
slid isaac rolled onto stomach pounded hands feet snow desperately trying anchor slope
downward slipped twenty feet fifteen feet ten feet toward edge cliff
boots seemed mere feet going
wave slowed isaacs descent
jumped tried swim higher slope
seconds later jumped back buried limbs snows around
pulled hard rope holding inevitable
like malevolent entity snow raged top threatening punishing presence mountain
isaac fought life began downward slide toward cliff
fifteen feet ten feet five feet

determined anger positioned behind breastwork wagons supplies band confederates located sources gunfire coming opposite side river higher foothills unleashed first many volleys retaliation repel
union soldiers lay stomachs reloaded heard sound lead crashing branches thickets confederates searched targets trial error
next round union sharpshooters confederates lay dead wounded volley came pinpointing unions exact positions
orders aim low confederates returned fire lower banks river
cries pain agony testified confederates skill several union soldiers lay dead permanently maimed slowly reducing effective force
confederates union soldiers defensive scrambled moment regrouping smaller fighting force
unbeknownst union command beyond city limits confederates loaded several cannons
tucked away grove tall oaks protection elements easily missed opposing force
quickly three man teams loaded cannons took careful aim union battery
command fire confederates opened union forces staged foothills signal mountain
visibility drastically reduced repeated cannon fire union forces struggled see targets
time union artillery brigade saw heavy smoke confederate volley late
scream fragmentation canisters telegraphed arrival union soldiers stand watch horror tiny projectiles grew larger vision speed leaving little else stand watch impending death
first four canisters roared camp impacted ground two cannon batteries immediately exploding tiny shards twisted molten metal
instantly thousands fragments traveled point impact found first victims two union soldiers stood two cannons

last canister rocketed heads union soldiers hit birch tree high trunk exploding instantly amputating upper half lower
crash tree hit ground went unnoticed union forces turned destructive force onto cloud confederate smoke far beyond chattanooga
wave sword gen negley bellowed order silence cannons far edge town
quickly teams three jockeyed cannons toward fading confederate smoke calculated angle trajectory lit charges
repositioned cannons came life muzzles spewed fire smoke metallic death recoil sending reeling backward restraints
seconds later far beyond city proper primary explosions seen shells hit targets followed several secondary explosions signaling destruction enemy ammo caches ignited result primary detonation
violently jolted lazy stare river young boy sitting elevated boulder fishing breakfast nearly fell water reflex loud explosions
quickly gathered things jumped rock rock desperately fleeing cover
still bank river found two large boulders hide behind giving safe cover violent exchange
closer action two bedraggled trappers upon hearing deafening explosions killing countrymen quickly deduced safe escape continue poling river

standing left side raft without warning single stray bullet whistled air impacted back first trappers head
lead ball mushroomed shattered skull propelling bone brain blood front tattered clothes river
instantly fell overboard floated downstream
shock witnessing death companion remaining trapper cried anguish helplessly watched friend floating away trailing behind path red water
reality snapped back focus another bullet embedded one logs raft fracturing sending tiny splinters water
looked back pelts beaver muskrat deceased friend toiled previous two months
hesitated moment grabbed handful beaver pelts rifle tiny strongbox money quickly jumped water
struggling stay afloat weight rifle kicked boots wildly water
head dipped surface let go rifle feet touched bottom

set two coffee cans thirty yards away paced forty yards boy held handguns
target left shoot left hand using revolver
one right use ruger
fire quickly maintaining accuracy emilio instructed
boy hefted pistols getting feel weight
knew hundreds hours experience firing big bore revolver required different skills smaller caliber automatic
besides difference recoil considerable adjusted revolver used trigger pull rotate cylinder held bullets requiring significantly pressure causing reflex make shooters fire high pulling target
firing revolver hands military crouch hard enough weak hand adjusting low recoil ruger almost impossible challenge
many pounds trigger pressure ruger
boy asked
wonder youre situation use someone elses weapon whether theyll able answer
guess emilio replied
boy shrugged
never hurt ask
calculated distance began firing alternating weapons rapidly uncontrolled manner
pair cans theyd filled water sprouted leaks
emptying weapons direction walked inspect results
six possible hits revolver five found mark
nine emilio loaded ruger found
heh

young man calling raul terenova good supposed
names unimportant
disposable everything life
raul excelled brutal training conditions truth told kinder relaxed ones hed imposed upon years
learned lot especially explosives side
nothing like military proffer kind training couldnt get civilian life no matter
goal expert every aspect combat special forces teach tenacity discipline hed quickly climbed top class established records
became model men follow demanding anything trainers mustered
young raul far motivated classmates get service years
viewed time military stepping stone whereas peers go career soldiers
becoming naval commando idea hed grown fixated sixteen reading services plans create group super soldiers
didnt burning desire become marine going excel field hed contemplating skills valuable

no question moving ahead queue putting specialized marine training became obvious one new elite commandos
today working specialized sniping long range considered anything thousand meters almost thirty three hundred feet
extreme distances variety elements came play including wind strength direction humidity temperature elevation rate movement wasnt stationary target
recorded instances snipers successfully killing twenty four hundred meters considered anomalies
sixteen hundred meters target mile away
hit distance accuracy considered virtually impossible impossibly small group expert marksmen although advents like laser rangefinders computer software calculate various elements improved odds
days exercise targets confirmed distance thousand meters roughly three quarters mile
rifle using exercise american manufactured barrett m82 caliber rifle effective range eighteen hundred meters although accuracy became iffy nine hundred thousand meters
sixteen hundred meters considered acceptable trying hit bomb something larger human torso many variables affect accuracy
many snipers preferred smaller caliber rifles precision official sniper rifle marines heckler koch psg1 firing millimeter round
problem weapons accuracy dropped eight hundred meters special forces secured fifteen much larger payload barrett rifles trial standardization substitute smaller psg1
sniper cadet assigned coach gave firing order received report field
accuracy dropped markedly seven hundred meter threshold crossed deliver precise hits eight hundred
nose tell
coach asked raul
moderate humidity
guesstimate wind speed direction
seven ten knots north east raul replied
temperature
thirty degrees celsius
going without computer
purely based observations
youre confident observations adjust bearings accordingly
good luck coach said stepped back leaving young man
raul concentrated controlling breathing soon entire awareness synthesized tiny world within scope
made minor corrections wind speed guesstimate gently massaged trigger weapon fired slamming shoulder considerable recoil
hed long ago learned never pull trigger throw accuracy
deliberate squeeze best
radio crackled report came back
bulls eye
good shooting
repeated exercise ten shots landed within ten inch grouping
think done young man
impressive shooting
raul looked coach
emboldened success wanted try personal best
got along well man floated idea
dont try fifteen hundred meters
make interesting
raul suggested
coach looked like crazy
pretty cocky huh
thats impossible range weapon ammo mention scope
want put money
coach asked
fifteen hundred meters mile away near absolute maximum rifles range human sized target
two hundred pesos says nail three five
although agree ammo crap distance
prefer load better consistency hey raul said
fine
three misses go home two hundred richer
coach got radio issued instructions man downrange obligingly moved target farthest point field taking cover
funeral
fire ready coach said
raul took time made adjustments scope repeated meditation process became one weapon
discharge almost startled focused concentration
no need wait radio report
knew say
bulls eye twenty centimeters center radio crackled
right left
low high
tell specific
raul groused
wide eyed coach studied raul like another planet posed question
response came back
right
thats thought hed say
winds died hair last thirty seconds
tell clear raul said
got go ahead repeated impossible shot
four times
shots grouped foot variance
coach gladly handed two hundred pesos single astounding display marksmanship hed ever witnessed
youre fucking monster know
thats superhuman voodoo shit right
ive never seen anything like ive teaching ten years
one top three marksmen mexico coach acceded studying kind wonder
men laughed together spite twenty five year age difference
raul never shoot accuracy distance preferring limit performance average expectations
wouldnt show develop much reputation
better one million day graduate top third class top
remembered emilios sage counsel sprout
never show much hand
give enemies information make gift
friends become enemies
know good take private pleasure accomplishment
becoming celebrated makes target
better middle herd hunters come head
evening raul enjoyed place spotlight amongst peers news exploit circulated
much enjoyed adulation part knew hubris came best fickle charm resolved enjoy last time allowed others get glimpse actually
information power allowing no inviting others understand capabilities foolhardy
goal drain experience service slip away like ghost
serve no useful purpose noticed already
point adopt lower profile continue accumulate pearls experience work done
calculated another three months training perhaps six months field sufficient making total year half life devoted pursuit excellence mexicos finest
night lay head upon bunk began silent mental countdown
begin new new life
patience told virtue pay enormous dividends became bedtime mantra
needed maximize learning still school
thats viewed life point hed arrived education

still wanted learn special operations parachuting jumping planes controlling descent rather precision guiding drop within meter target point high altitude low required different skills
still needed hours scuba time well orientation flying planes helicopters

walking headfirst killing zone generally bad strategy anywhere world mexico couldnt see commander barreling forward plan doomed failure
least hoped
sentry exterior bridge carrying machine pistol sort looked like uzi raul
meant limited useful range accuracy
uzi antiquated design effective range two hundred meters fine typical close quarter urban combat lousy applications requiring accuracy distance
better popular choice far raul concerned kalashnikov akm modernized version venerated double effective range single fire mode least three hundred meters fired full auto probably best weapon personal favorite dependability accuracy mid range assault rifle american built
five hundred meter effective range extremely high muzzle velocity made ideal choice assault applications compensated relatively small slug size

struggling internal debate commander murmured com system
one two men dock earpiece upon hearing commanders instructions grabbed friend turned around noticing two smoking men cautiously approaching
mission aborted
shit commander hissed began pacing mulling choices
theyd probably pull armored vehicles hard way shooting no element surprise
raul bit tongue decided advance idea purely interests keeping role assault interesting getting practical experience
taking single sentry almost thousand meters wasnt really much challenge
single shot
maybe two send someone find armor piercing rounds
sir
might word
raul asked
commander regarded surprise
raul one best men never spoke
loner no close relationships within corps
isnt great moment
yes sir
know sir
observation came watching target may use sir raul explained sucking pride taking expected supplicant tone
well
make quick commander barked
need coordinate frontal assault goes much longer
permission approach sir
get
raul moved commanders side spoke low calm tone explaining ideas arguing amphibian assault
commander listened carefully cut forty five seconds
require far stealth luck weve tonight
good strategy appreciate sharing dont think afford waste two hours preparing
no think well good old fashioned frontal assault take punches
end wed one anyway plan failed call cut chase commander declared summarily dismissing idea
raul considered arguing point decided didnt care much
hed still get shoot couple bad guys least care end half squad got mowed
yes sir
thank hearing sir
going frontal please get magazine armor piercing rounds
theyll come handy take gunman inside bridge raul requested
commander nodded called com one team members waiting next building
twenty minutes
youll
well move thirty
commander spun around began issuing orders preparation brute force assault
theyd need couple armored personnel carriers enough carry forty men
ordered two unimog armored trucks two btr armored carriers eight wheeled vehicles accommodate seven commandos along three man crew operate turret mounted heavy machine gun smaller machine gun
fallback plan much straightforward
drive ship
deploy men no firing takes place seize ship
sentries crew decided shoot blast away everything sight shoot way ship crew either surrendered dead
inelegant result lot bullets flying benefit simplicity
twenty five minutes later young commando approached raul handed magazine five rounds armor piercing caliber bullets apologizing couldnt find short notice
raul thanked emptied half one spare magazines counting five shells replacing five armor piercing rounds
ejected current bullet rifle chambered one new armor piercing cartridges returned watching sentries night vision scope
commander checked watch precisely three forty ordered assault everything happened quickly
two gray btr 70s resembled small tanks anything else rumbled around corner onto pier followed two hulking trucks
sentries dock froze staring numb disbelief apparition hurriedly scuttled gangplank disappeared ship
one mans head reappeared seconds gangplank collapsed onto concrete pier
crash almost immediately followed steel watertight door slamming shut boom
barred within grinding cogs audible halfway dock even baritone growl vehicles
going considerably harder take freighter traffickers forewarned
easy access ship gangplank gone commandos dock siege situation ship whose hull rose easily four stories pier no obvious entry point available
commander watched kind frozen frustration shooting started gunmen emerged interior ship moved edge hull began firing behind protection heavy steel hardy old vessel built
raul took situation moments waiting right instant squeezed trigger
guns boom deafening
ears ringing watched satisfaction sentry standing outside bridge man inside collapsed

no reason waste precious ammo
swiveled attention hull make heads popping like nocturnal version whack mole fairground stall

raul peered scope trying find obvious targets gunmen along side ship figured sniper work retreated superstructure barring watertight deck entry door process
gun turrets btr 70s opened armor piercing rounds quickly discovered shells easily penetrate one half inch steel plate denting massive hull fashioned considerably thicker material

shooting ship stopped lone gunman hadnt made inside time behind bulk bridges tower rauls line sight
firing two btr 70s also stopped though entire waterfront area still resonated receding echoes gunfire
commander barked orders radio men emptied personnel carriers took position mount assault

chapter ten years ago sinaloa mexico eighteen months joining marines raul disappeared without trace leaving nothing behind remembered except assumed name hed quickly grown despise
hed participated seven operations first one mission became convinced talents wasted wasnt progressing
make matters worse witnessed countless acts bumbling bureaucracy ranking officers costing men command casualties no good reason
anything ever convinced wouldnt well working someone else half year active duty completing boot camp specialized training done trick
walked base last time ostensibly two days leave go visit fictional family chiapas audible sigh relief
raul saved almost meager pay still thousand dollars money hed left home selling weapons convert assets cash

hed learned trust judgment things hopped bus began long trip veracruz culiacan
wearing uniform special forces commando afforded privilege bus company thankfully cost almost nothing cross nation
two days hed left naval career behind descended stairs culiacan blinking bright sunlight early spring day
forty two hours cramped buses eating whatever junk get irregular stops first order business decent meal

asked innocently
sadie danced back forth tail whipping air frenzy everything power convey master indeed wanted
find someone wanted go walk
manuel exclaimed sadie began whining pranced doorway occasionally leaping air twirling completely around canine display balletic prowess
manuel decided give dog break torture although knew enjoyed buildup much enjoyed reaction
together moved bedroom door made way hall wholly unlikely pair
stopped kitchen greeted maria cook already simmering something heavenly smelling expansive viking stove top
whats
asked
machaca remarosa replied softly
maria sixty los mochis north culiacan sea cortez remarkably talented cook
shed quarter forty years still looked forward meals every day
make sure low fat
remember diet chided rubbing ample belly grin
always remarosa maria assured
manuel brutal killer executed twenty competitors two decades ascending cartel ladder sinaloa loved mother four children dog wife two mistresses
marias cooking
never occurred question lifestyle hed come streets hed started collector one aranas cells worked way current position one altamars trusted lieutenants making ten million dollars every year
boy slums terminated education age twelve live wits streets culiacan
cartel game made rich man wanted nothing
get hands dirty
hed murdered first man thirteen using bread knife never looked back
life relatively tranquil reign new boss hardly kill anyone far year anomaly business
time peace happy reaping rewards altamars rule
still remembered bad time years back miguel executed streets running red blood
hed pack family send lake chapala worst
months hed lived like terrorist commander hiding life different anonymous locations waged guerilla war competitors day
like anything else supposed
good times good times
wasnt perfect nobody got rich mexico without getting bloody
hed made choices prevailed
couldnt complain
manuel lumbered entry door sadie springing alongside stepped outside crisp air bright new morning
loved time day
cool enough werent sweating clothes rainy season hadnt started yet
spring perfect time live sinaloa relished season joy alcoholic full bottle
morning shift bodyguards dutifully waiting outside two terrain vehicles weapons cradled laps ready jog whatever time begin
hola chicos
another good one
manuel greeted men
no reply answered
none expected
werent friends no matter warm fuzzy acted understood role protect chat
sadie whined nudged hand nose anxious get underway
manuel began stretching using columns porch support smiling beloved dog barely puppy
searing lances white hot pain shot upper body chest exploded
blood splattered sadie men burst gunfire brush pounded torso
men froze momentarily taking cover wherever shooting haphazardly area gunfire come
two atvs gunned motors went tearing direction sniper first one others head exploded vehicles slowing turning aimlessly operators dead
two guards porch taken refuge behind heavy stone columns firing without conviction dense foliage propertys perimeter
manuel stared blearily complex herringbone pattern brickwork dome built roof porch cupula breath gurgling holes chest life ran onto rustic stone floor
sadie approached nosed face licking flecks blood chin effort comfort warm tongue last thing ever register
eyes met instant grew wide noisily exhaled long groaning rattle shuddering stillness
sadie lay beside master stood circled
nudged nose dogs done since time theyd joined humans companions caves sat pointed head heavens let forth baleful howl filled sadness pain world
beloved master gone
alone surviving
chapter mean altamar missing
fuck mean
missing
jorge encarlo screamed cell phone
mean decided disappear bang fifteen year old days mean hes mulch tomato field
jefe telling everything know
heard friend friend went missing yesterday organization scrambling find
doesnt sound like young love voice phone advised
encarlo bulldog man heavily muscled buzz cut closely cropped four day shadow
anything else
god damn get information
dont care
really big someones taken cocksucker encarlo snarled
know

know goes
nobodys going talk think wind beheaded
right
get
problem altamars taken need move rapidly well good dead encarlo warned
everything
really
give time ill find
came easy getting anyone crew talk
theyre chatty types remember
encarlo silently counted three
look
paying tell hard job
paying
fucking job get intelligence ill find someone
encarlo fuming nobody take anger
stared little motorola flip phone latest model snapped closed frustration
hell going altamar
really missing way suggested never reappearing except pieces floating river encarlo needed get positioned take action lieutenants
worked
king dead long live whoever left smoke cleared hosed blood sidewalks
didnt make rules survivor nonetheless
thirty one already reputed mover even cartel standards utterly ruthless
hed learned early shock awe went long way towards moving food chain prone violent outbursts slaughter slightest provocation
modus operandi served good stead
encarlo owned recycling plant shipped product united states processed provided excellent cover shipping items north well
operation one many responsible growing methamphetamine traffic slowly displacing crack cocaine many areas
booming market rock bottom production cost profits trafficking synthetic drug swelling accounts
made cocaine trade seem like small potatoes growth curve kept
picked unconsciously scabbed area left ear
nervous tick one many hed developed constant pressure stay one step ahead rest wolf pack
encarlo used products consumed fair amount meth cocaine cocktail stimulants enabled sleep four hours stint
firmly believed much success thanks long hours worked addition innate cunning born streets
traits combined relentless sadistic bent sociopathic streak envy serial killer made perfect mid level cartel functionary
men competitors terrified good reason chemical supplementation often resulted erratic mood swings set bloody tirade virtually anything
right antennae picking vibrations opportunity early news altamars mysterious disappearance
knew confirm man actually gone good hed perfectly positioned capitalize situation take rivals knew hit
got dangerous facts known lieutenants time thats became killing field one left standing
hed gone multiple times never guarantee make next one no matter much badass
idea creating loose coalition like altamar never entered head
look weaker competitors cooperation simply eliminate claim networks
outreach approach worked altamar encarlos opinion flawed plan weak man evidenced taken two years top little hub
needed know going needed know
anxiety building knew harsh experience something salient
anything
sitting waiting feedback reactive tastes
restless tapped line cocaine help focus quickly snorted using gold tube carried purpose
brushed little gums shook head clear
drug coursing system encarlo resolved see shake loose information
hed hit street see anything came back personal contacts
confidence men couldnt sit still wait
glancing watch noted already nine thirty morning
time move
stabbed keypad office phone barked orders calling car brought around
next dialed second command told get three men packing heavy heat meet vehicle five minutes
encarlo opened file cabinet retrieved glock 9mm pistol slipped windbreaker pocket
small gun packed decent wallop hated wear shoulder holster like undercover cop
hed tried ankle holster bothered easier carry thing pocket
encarlo made way downstairs ground level strode office doors past heavy industrial equipment yard toward truck silver fully loaded lincoln navigator custom rims steel armored plates welded four doors
three men joined toting variety submachine guns
didnt like screw around went town believed prepared assault times
wasnt much paranoia occupational hazard kept alive far
driver nodded climbed passenger seat three enforcers climbing behind
one reasons liked big suv enough room three grown men back
truck moved toward front gates opened via configuration hydraulic pistons activated security guard booth street exploded blossom orange fire
concussion plastique affixed gas tank shattered windows nearby buildings pieces truck spiraled mushroom cloud black smoke inevitably dropping like icarus back earth
nothing survived sort blast men came running slim hope salvaging anything
rey took several snapshots little camera across thoroughfare
put ford lobo gear pulled away road final destination day third target point already good neutralized
lushly green acreage around luis barragan inspired mansion hills outside culiacan still late morning doldrums absence breeze seasonal effect made outdoors swelter unpleasant even seasoned natives
armed sentries prowled immaculately manicured grounds around house jittery adrenaline sweating heat
since early morning theyd guard state high alert
ricardo pilar sat inner circle square mesquite table dining room
five men closest counselors serious demeanors air thick cigarette smoke anxiety
hed gotten several frantic phone calls alerting explosion encarlos plant troubled implications
pilar sensed move made wasnt sure behind hed dispatched group armed men see information get network lower level cartel soldiers acted informal communication channel street
preliminary reports come back werent good
two four rivals departed earth morning violent circumstances
one explanation warranted swift decisive action
pilars nemesis valiente making play leadership position altamar held cartel underboss officially missing significant enough time
mean war pilar seasoned veteran countless purges fights
pilar educated attended university monterey held degree business administration served well creating managing network
hed studied taken heart lessons business school fancied superior ignorant thugs whod ascended equal footing sheer brutality barrel gun
understood place bloodshed liked think knee jerk reactions involving indiscriminate slaughter
no fool sensed time put diploma strap pistols
captain eduardo arguing passionately lieutenants nodding approval
chance
weve patient foolishness sit waiting war come
valiente offensive best chance avoid bloodbath make pre emptive strike
cut head snake body stops moving
pilar considered counsel nodded
agree eduardo
explosion killed encarlo combined news remarosas execution ominous
bad feeling think safe conclude valiente making major offensive mean next
like waltz start shooting solve problem
valiente far smart taken way
pilar pushed back table stood began pacing compulsively spoke
sympathize everyones passion argue misplaced
yes need act also need coherent plan
right bluster talk
lets finish discussion whether removing valiente good idea

want hear ideas pilar said gesturing bottle pelgrino emphasize point
men looked none daring advance idea shoot
heres going
want talk among think best eliminate valiente end day
put proposals table come something makes sense
dont waste time arguing something thats decided
need ideas passion
instinct says running time time get busy
pilar glanced watch sighed
commitments need attend
make no mistake valiente must die sun goes relying come achieve
pilar fixed man turn intense stare bristled quiet menace
may veneer civility education dangerous cornered pit viper men quick remember hed made top group
ill back shortly
make good use time
pilar strode room shaking head
classic turf battle needed get top valientes goons showed machine guns
wasnt afraid compound well equipped latest alarms electronic sensors advance warning devices enough firepower stop battalion
felt safe home confident attempt going made wouldnt happen
dense foliage extended miles created natural barrier one road
moment least safe
pilar thought valientes likely next step wasnt overly concerned frontal assault
vulnerable ways besides obvious
power struggle lasted long business negatively impacted cause disruption among lieutenants dangerous shooting war
bad enough pilars rivals homicidal psychopaths without worry younger junior aspirants throne cutting heart slept
moved pocket doors separated great room rear deck took beauty grounds
times extreme adversity defined leaders even though fancied civilized man understood necessary swift unequivocal response threat
pilar no problem killing went territory
hed always tried keep violence arms length always successful enabled maintain presumption superiority
something tree line caught sun pilar squinted make
hair arms bristled detected movement flash neurons brain ordering body drop floor high velocity partially jacketed round blew cheekbone apart taking better part cerebrum
time guards chance respond single shot perimeter shooter long since departed sound dirt bike hed pushed silently half mile noisy memory woods
mexico citys sky laden hulking dark clouds rey pulled hills infamously dangerous metropolitan traffic
toyota run like champ pleasure drive softening blows rutted patches culiacan distrito federal locals referred mexico city
hed gotten contact information man valiente new patron sponsor known since childhood
valiente made phone call proposed relationship friend couldnt possibly refuse
man owned pawn shop hed fallen leveraging contacts underworld facilitator extermination work human kind
difficult role basically good decent man money simply attractive turn no risk proposition
three contractors handled domestic disputes business disagreements took twenty percent contract price handle money vet clients
rey needed someone trustworthy launder money deal payments
going professionally needed front office speak professional representation
handle sourcing jobs couldnt haul around several million dollars hundreds effective
needed banker accountant
valientes contact seemed ideally suited role
valiente warned friend dealing lest get bright idea take reys money run hills
cartels vouched someone made introduction someone screwed person youd introduced expect held accountable recommendations actions
valiente seen enough reys handiwork short period know didnt want coming
narcotraficante chief become reys biggest admirer promised spread word prowess return commitment never accept contract
seemed reasonable rey valiente comer powerful cartel planet sponsors go worse
plan limit activity hits year steadily increase fee charged well level difficulty sanctions accepted became highest paid killer world
mexico right place given amount money flowing cartels although hed heard good things russia
problem didnt speak language
hed studied english school course spanish

wouldnt work petersburg vladivostok
merged toward right lane took ramp clogged freeway even congested area city
circling around half hour eventually located pawn shop managed find parking spot
threw black duffel bag shoulder made way two blocks store
neighborhood sketchy even mexico city standards saying lot money lenders last resort didnt tend located ritziest areas
glass door shop noted bars everywhere providing security night incursions well roll metal awning completely seal storefront
bars seemed like overkill rey liked hinted man took precautions engineered
careful man needed
establishment modest measure suggested lack braggadocio hubris
strongly positive reys position
pushed open entry door walked small somewhat shabby showroom inexpensive glass cases showcasing tarnished treasures impoverished downtrodden
silver infant cups cheap watches scarred gold chains obsolete cameras
rey liking guys style
last place world expect find man handled affairs high end contract killers
nothing shop spoke money success high rolling usually hand hand cartel related businesses
said boring
rey liked boring
approached barred window fabricated inch thick bullet proof glass pushed button next listening buzzer echoed rear behind heavy steel door right

chapter sydney unlike place rey ever
time got plane qantas first class experience welcome luxury fifteen hour flight los angeles struck clean everything
someone scrubbed every surface right got entire town far see wandering around downtown area like
took cab airport hotel blocks sydney harbor stowed gear locking cash hotel room safe unpacking hygiene kit
hours sleep get adjusted seven hour time difference set explore town hed understand layout
four minute walk ferry terminal circular quay quickly convinced town filled tourists one mexico wouldnt stick one fears
never wanted memorable anywhere went no problem judging host accents languages heard moved along waterfront quaint shopping area called rocks toward opera house
rey approached iconic theater sat point waters edge aggressive shape unmistakable almost every photo postcard hed seen
kept walking towards ocean soon found verdant well groomed park passed young lovers reposing grass stealing moments together school
weather equivalent late autumn australia seasons reversed northern hemisphere still relatively mild sunnier hed expected
clean
used mexico sydney shock system aseptic
even made way park area supposedly seedier nice best neighborhoods back home
stopped long pier sign front announced finger wharf looked hotel built harbor sydney felt immediately comfortable dimly lit soothing minimalistic contemporary lobby
deserted save young woman working behind desk based ambience solitary location decided right hed moving following day
walking away harbor explored area inland hotel
quickly degraded run industrial district warehouses alongside shabby lower income housing
buildings looked though undergo renovation much area desolate found person streets mid afternoon weekday
made mental note perfect mind
hed begun outlines rough plan plane purely conceptual everything panned work well
another hour meandering streets adjacent waterfront made way back hotel hailed cab asked driver drop two streets away address chilango lived
drove upscale area fifteen minutes city center cab stopped front small market block harbor
neighborhood eclectic exhibiting hodgepodge architectural styles coexisting dissonant manner
everything elegant multi story turn century victorian mansions post modern contemporary found
certainly prosperous area judging cars trim houses
rey knew waterfront homes anywhere world always expensive figured australia no different
bought bottle water bored shopkeeper strolled towards targets address relieved find sidewalks empty
reached junction dead ended target street deliberately avoided chilangos house preferring make left street ran along waterfront homes rather right
knew former cartel chiefs home four right intersection made turn didnt really need see much glancing street though stray sightseer whod wandered area
knew report hed read plane two story five bedroom waterfront home double lot security lighting night activated motion sensors sides house well street
comfortable feel neighborhood walked six blocks came major artery coffee shop call taxi enjoyed cup pungent green tea

valientes voice answered

rey asked
valiente gave sydney cell number
youll want ask victor valiente said terminated call nothing discuss
instructed gravelly australian voice answered
rey told man town used valientes name way entre
arranged meet hour later caf immediately front ferry terminal
victor wearing orange shirt blue windbreaker tan cargo pants
rey watched vantage point across busy common man dressed described entered caf sat window
five minutes scanning quay ensure no surveillance rey strolled took seat opposite
victor mid forties rail thin heavily lined sun damaged face boasting perennial flush habitual hard drinker spectacularly crooked teeth thatches salt pepper hair pointing directions
looked like nothing much absentminded professor boozing problem
gday mate
names victor
told give yah whatever yah needed mums word victor started
rey couldnt really make man saying instead began speaking quiet calm voice
english passable years study still heavily accented spanish inflection

following day victor made arrangements cabin cruiser pick rey pier marina hosted hotel adjacent condominiums restaurants
checked current hotel walked taking waterfront room week third floor
hed unpacked grabbed quick bite downstairs heading meet boat heavy set binoculars around neck
thirty eight foot riviera sports fisherman twin diesel engines soon cutting chop fair clip
rey gave captain gps coordinates portion harbor wanted anchor fish
man looked though crazy
wont catch much muck suckers mate advised
thats okay
like water enjoying scenery looking beautiful houses rey explained
motored designated spot dropped anchor
captain dutifully got two light tackle salt water fishing rods bag frozen bait
rey played along allowed man drop line water went inside salon heavily tinted windows blocked anyone seeing
raised binoculars scanned house noting neighbors homes searching anything afford advantage
paid special attention shore area distances homes wasnt much
fortunately chilango built tall walls either side security privacy wouldnt deal neighbor issues inside
sat bobbing wake boats cruising past noted three security men nosing around one report led believe
either house received sort warning surveillance sloppy
instead day man night one six total three three
spent two hours anchor boat rocking gently rey mainly watching house
lunchtime hed seen enough
target visible several times living room bedroom cinch take single shot
unfortunately wasnt paid
reconciling unpleasant reality hed hard way announced captain time leave
one two rods screamed line tore reel skipper ran tighten drag
set hook offered pole rey shook head no interest trying fight fish
moments line went limp captain reeled leader bitten
probably shark said

rey asked curious

frightful big buggers
one gets yer days pretty much ruined
dont want mess one ill tell yah warned

imagine
evening rey phone discussion victor arranged meeting next day look industrial space hed gotten inventory hardware
morning blue ford sedan pulled curb original hotel rey stayed
victor grinned behind wheel inviting get
soon motoring deserted area near turns arrived bleak strip old industrial warehouses
victor got opened one heavy steel doors stepped dilapidated twenty forty brick space reeked stale air urine
rey tried lights two fluorescent bulbs flickered struggling stay lit flash suddenly illuminated
assassin studied shabby interior arms crossed nodded

glancing around dank room final time rey dictated additional list items hed need based surveillance target appraisal new workspace
victor scribbled furiously small notebook rey ticked requirements
finished eyed overhead steel beams supported roof rey made two requests
victor nodded assured within forty eight hours space outfitted went car removed long duffle requested hardware brought inside space
rey inspected item carefully nodded approval
perhaps victor resembled buffoon hed gotten everything right first try
good
hoped victor well second round stuff
none specialized confident man able get
three days later returned warehouse
completely transformed
rey impressed
hed spent parts last days targets neighborhood driving around victor studying layout watcher confirm number guards night well
chilango rarely left house whatever wine business apparently run home
make things somewhat harder far easier stage something target transit played cards dealt rey confident
tomorrow show time either justify considerable money hed spending course antipodean vacation die trying
chapter stiff gusts wind blew tall oak trees near waters edge occasionally eliciting moaning lament airs harmonic passage branches
partially cloudy night sliver moon peeking overcast
lights surrounding homes harbor twinkled danced roiling surface water reflected moving time swell harbor mouth surged outcropping shore point piper upscale neighborhood called nub land thrusting water creating double bay one side rose bay
three tough looking guards prowled grounds targets home two stationed front back one circulating around
lot security relatively modest home safe area
neighbors wonder occupant
men best appear discreet obviously trained killers military bearings tell tale bulges handguns windbreaker jackets
easiest duty ever
endless hours nothing guarding nobody imagined threats never materialized
theyd gotten complacent nine months theyd working gig understandable given uneventful nature job
made man happy money spend liked werent going complain
fifteen thousand american dollars month apiece theyd put trapeze performance ride unicycles tightrope every evening thats patron wanted
quiet one weeknight cars winding way along new south head road tracked coastline
sydneys suburbs asleep citizenry enjoying well deserved rest privileged enclave
small black inflatable dinghy moved towards shore slicing small swells made silent way night
hundred yards point operator dropped anchor water cutting little electric motor
sat rising falling waves getting sense amplitude acclimating
waterside targets home glimmered luminescent green night vision scope
rey easily make sentry sitting rear deck smoking cigarette reading book
unprofessional given biggest threat security team thought likely encounter enraged koala eucalyptus fueled rampage appreciate lackadaisical attitude
last mistake ever made
still understandable
crosshairs modified assault rifles night scope bounced waves weapon made ungainly additional weight long flash suppressing silencer affixed barrels end
surface movement decrease likely accuracy hed spent hours rural area town sighting victor yesterday exactly required distance margin error acceptable variance two inches
additional factor brisk breeze automatically made mental adjustment
blowing harbor mouth toward point back shouldnt huge effect
hed spent prior morning loading twenty shells special blend powerful charge compensate velocity difference silencer introduced proved worthwhile sighting
higher powered payload attenuated distortion introduced device

tommy fallen butt soon feet hit ground
soft ground luckily
clumpy grass heels resting rock
rock spongy
weird
looked like rock felt like pillow
maybe dream thought
pinched hurt
looked around everything clear day
definitely dream
stood felt little dizzy leaned rested hands knees
blinked eyes several times stared ground
little blue ants scurrying every way around soft rock
realized clump grass sitting also interesting shade blue like color noelles eyes
laughed thinking silly thought
straightened dizziness gone
strange feeling knew way home
hill
hill boasted two tall blue spruce trees
tall
blue
really looked around saw trees blue
blue leaves every branch
tommy scared place felt comfortable
started path toward spruce trees stopped neared top
hear voices
safe side decided step path hide behind tree
voices sounded friendly never knew
tommy peered around blue branches watched
step lightly miss gwinn said tall red haired man passed pretty young woman
step lightly zerd responded
tommy frowned greetings wondering happened traditional good morning good afternoon
neither two people headed way
miss gwinn went right toward two story building zerd went left toward pen holding several pink sheep
least tommy thought sheep sounds making sounded less like bleating like meowing
interesting place tommy thought noticed two people coming behind building
heard greetings lowered voices spoke whispers
one pointed toward tommys hideout two looked quickly
miss gwinn went inside building telling friends step lightly goodbye
aware maybe step open thought decided
turned headed back hill took path opposite direction
wound around several blue trees forest blue
several rocks littering path every one stepped soft springy
began bouncing way along rock rock
suddenly voice stopped cold
step lightly young man
tall zerd stood holding pink sheep leash
marns wont take kindly stepping backs young
tommy see man concerned quite angry

tommy asked

said word visitor stress last syllable visitor
marns soft rocks
theyre sensitive
tommy looked path back man animal

zerd reached sheep grabbed handful pink wool
stretched hand offering pink stuff tommy didnt know
gingerly reached hand palm zerd deposited fluffy stuff middle
tommy stared zerd see confused put two hands around tommys squeezed pink wool fist
tommy opened hand surprised find hard round pink coin
zerd abruptly turned spoke shoulder step lightly
tommy said thank softly step lightly
watched man sheep go back right fork trail
sheep meowing followed
stepping lightly around marns
tommy turned coin hand held closer eyes

doldale thought keep taking left fork stay marns pay eat eventually ill get back grandmas cuz visitor
chuckled took left trail
walked seemed like hours hours miles miles without seeing another human animal
stomach started growl thought gum pocket
might help chew thought preferred sandwich dinner knew grandmother probably making right
unwrapped stick rolled ball putting mouth
crumpled wrapper tossed away
suddenly loud roar huge lion like creature appeared behind large marn
head typical lions mane body fat pig like curly short tail
mane white framed dark brown face body tail gray tone
tommy stood frozen spot beast sniffed gum wrapper intermittently roared
maybe penalty littering doldale death
tommy finally got feeling back legs started run back way come
roars lion behind grew fainter tommy dared glance back see followed
group marns ahead looked like boulders
breathing heavily getting stitch side ached
slowed pace headed toward marns intending sit one rest
comfortable sitting large marn
quite soft noticed sweet scent wafting upwards
wasnt hungry imagine taking nap one soft creatures
heard burbly sound smelled aroma
breathed deeply
smelled like nothing particular everything general grandmas garden moms perfume dads cologne apple pie fresh cookies flowers meadow cinnamon pancakes
making stomach growl eyes grew heavy
scent drugging put head next marn stretched
odd yet comfortable bed second marn began softly burble well
aromas arose hot chocolate fudge popcorn roses tangerines
tommy sank deeper marns closed eyes
mouth fell open gum slipped
slept hard
chapter step lightly boy
tommy awoke start hard ground

angrily woman scolded

theyre almost dead
theyre flatter doldale coin
thinking

though zerd told always take left fork didnt think possible lion way
maybe old woman help gave back blue coins

tommy started climbing reached door automatically opened
leaped mat looked back door closed
old womans face window smiling
climb fast
tommy smiled waved lorlynns face disappeared
went around tree found way back path
marns slept puffed back original size something different
tree growing
hadnt
curiously tommy felt bark ran hand trunk
reached put weight branch
thing happen quickly
time screwed
leaves incredible new tree blue every growing thing
looked branches see pink rectangles scattered throughout
looked like sticks gum
tommy remembered chewing gum fell asleep marns
tree grown one piece chewed
jumped threw leg limb nimbly climbing new tree
reached stick gum smelled plunging mouth
yup
gum right flavor chewing
maybe drop coins thought start bank
dropped ground started left fork
tommy gone far thought gone expected encounter lion moment
started tiptoe case beast sleeping pass unnoticed
saw
sleeping fact snoring loudly shade new blue paper tree
paper looked like gum wrappers
almost made sense gum tree gum wrapper tree lion
visitor left create monster
stuffed animal
kept creeping following path stepping lightly around smallest marns chewing gum thinking wondering
happen next
chapter marn rocks crysta lins path ended abruptly wall rock
no going left right around mammoth rock without leaving safety path
boulder sized marns everywhere didnt dare step
climb look around
couldnt parent marn tommy hoped started climb
hard scratchy odd suddenly show blocking path
found another foothold heaved higher onto ledge
looked back blue landscape thought fuzzy things distance seemed
maybe needed glasses squinting lot blackboard last year
climbed straight came flat top somewhat spongy walk
reached pressed fingers rock
soft small marns stepped first arrived strange land
rock began vibrate tommy lost balance
tumbled forward rock perhaps mother marn started roll path
first leaped started walking upright stay top realized marn gathering speed going direction come
quickly scrambled forward backside
hard going escalator back mall
kicked landed thud path right first blocked giant marn marn behind
tommy hurried along stepping lightly course glancing back time time sure angry rock wasnt rolling way crush
two blue coins jingle jangled pocket kept rhythm speed
smaller marns way seemed spaced way hop skip patterns
became game got better faster paying attention anything around trail
peal thunder clapped loudly nearby followed three bangs
tommy watched lightning cloud sky
strangely sky turning normal blue sunset greens
shades green none usual sunset colors
thought crashing sound assumed thunder
replayed mind reminded grandfather clock wasnt supposed run past
four dongs close together must quarter something
path sloping downwards going easier fewer fewer marns avoid
green sunset spread like picture see outline cityscape beneath bottom shades green
path veering right soon disappear forest blue
tommy hesitant enter darkening woods since no better option continued
forest immediately enveloped sights sounds also strange smells
bad smells skunky smells burnt rubber smells ashtray smells
sounds better songbirds owls
sights strange
tree twisted grew unexpected directions
sometimes crawl climb limbs way trail
skunky smell pursued seemed grow stronger nostrils thought burst stink
breathed mouth found taste stench
chewing gum faster didnt help
trail grew narrower harder follow trees
ahead saw flock small birds darting tree tree singing madly
owl flew straight nipped ear
burst threw tangled branches blue spruce scattered songbirds
tommy stunned find path split two sets forks
sign two right paths said luruss steps
sign two left paths said doldale steps
wasnt hard decision tommy chose far left path doldale
one thousand nine hundred seventy nine steps maybe get
dark blue forest behind green sunset front knew hurry make dark
spit gum started counting steps loud running little half jogging
single marn get way kept eyes path looking something bopped head
stopped short hit behind
suspended golden threads large diamond shaped crystals floating air head front across trail
small silver sign side path warned latest phenomenon
beware crysta lins
breathe heavy stay doldale
tommy pondered message
obviously beautiful objects crysta lins since sign said beware might dangerous poisonous something
felt forehead first one smacked
wasnt bleeding bump itched
back head also sported lump scratched around spot
felt like giant mosquito bites
sign mean

johnny nancy hurry keep
walked white hallway white walls ceilings floors
felt like hospital except everything around seemed futuristic advanced somehow
even lights ceiling didnt look like coming regular light bulbs
ackers caught nancy studying ceiling walked
super sensitive digital interference probes shoot light
probes swirl around mapping three dimensional computer representation walk
representation stored computers cross referenced whenever need find world ackers said walked never slowing pace
nancy tell enjoyed showing liked trying appear smarter everyone else even meant putting making people feel bad
actually wondering everything white replied trying throw ackers
ackers no creativity johnny responded

limited budget time constraints many variables meld together effective color scheme
words nancys turn interrupt didnt time paint
ackers lifted eyebrow
far important things worry painting replied
walked white sterile hallway three started pass rooms either side reinforced plastic windows allowed look
variety training exercises technology testing sites different rooms
nancy looked saw man standing front large cannon
cannon erupted steady stream fire completely engulfed man
nancy couldnt see flames cannon turned man looking unharmed vastly relieved
invented sun tan lotion byproduct fire protection technology ackers explained
released public much milder dose course
lotion protects everything hair skin ultimate fire safety
ackers gave smug smile suggested didnt know smile well
extreme intelligence seemed lot ackers didnt know social interactions
next room passed completely empty

nancy stopped watch water started pouring like heavy rain ceiling
soon humanoid shape started appear middle rain arcs electricity dancing around finally took shape form man

ackers exclaimed
johnny nancy found way small cramped office
papers everywhere several desks put one chair
clear ackers worked alone possibly didnt like working people likely no one wanted work
walls also covered writing multiple whiteboards around room
usually sentence equation start white board written black marker
no space writing continue board onto wall sometimes even making way across wall onto new white board
clear ackers liked think
also clear probably no one alive follow line thought least well

johnny headed door
room draped shadows light coming entire wall regular monitors
side multiple holographic workstations displayed air hidden projectors around room
sense royalty room
carpet rich red large expensive paintings hidden darkness walls
people scrambling room work different work stations conversing low voices
set stairs led large chair shaped like throne widow black sat watched worker bees buzz activity
throne numerous small holographic keypads widow efficiently enter commands change work flow many people around
scar entered dimly lit room making sure keep wide berth around many people room
made way across rich carpet toward stairs lead throne
one workers got close scar couldnt help snarling keep distance
worker looked impassive face went business
faces unnerved scar concluded
none workers muscular control faces
locked neutral expression couldnt move mouths part head besides neck eyes
always turning looking impassively things gave scar creeps like nothing else world
course reason workers like androids built accomplishing tasks looking realistic
another one got close scar stared
pointless gesture doomed failure android couldnt even blink eyes even facial muscular control no eye lids
get way
scar said last shoving android aside continuing way throne
android fell clang
androids noticing companion fallen immediately stopped turned lidless eyes scar
one one left work fell line behind closing movements hemming toward throne
scar continued walk began become aware happening stealing glances corner eye
big strong didnt like prospect fight army androids
surely widow black call got far line
wasnt calling
turned smile dangerous gleam eye
scar continued walk toward throne androids continued close
already completely cut way back
mattered scar never ran anything ever
held head high walked right stand widow black
androids moved like zombies reaching grasping hands toward scar slow methodical precision
tensed bent slightly low ground prepared onslaught
might take wasnt going go without fight take many
might even lash opportunity presented
scar understand failure tolerated lost valuable artifact
thing place
even fight back died probably expect no less
scar widow black stared unsaid understanding hanging like serpent ready strike scar press button
broke eye contact looked finger poised holopad button bring life back androids sure death
moment thought pressed button thought saw finger move corresponding light emit holographic display beneath hand
nothing happened realized eyes played trick
feel getting jittery waiting becoming much
going let already
part cruelty part fear instilled others
widow black understood anticipation almost always worse punishment best make much part punishment become
scar forced look back meet cold hard gaze
slowly moved hand away holopad controlled androids
scar judged distance throne
wanted try charge got hand back near activation button
widow black stood throne took step toward scar frozen army androids around
scars breath caught throat
well away command controls nothing time got
strong incredibly strong
no doubt probably overpower
continued walk toward malice evident eyes
throne well behind
widow black walked almost casually brimming anger
delivering message didnt need androids take care
also invitation let try attack felt dared
hesitated unsure
physical power one thing no real idea capable didnt know tricks hiding
fact really didnt know anything
thing scar felt knew sure attacked failed end
staring cold dark eyes scar wondered already late
widow black lifted arm struck across face back hand
scar stumbled take balancing step keep falling
hit hard scar reassess thought strength
taste blood mouth
willing risk fight
scar straightened met gaze
moment subdued wasnt going challenge authority power
didnt say anything looked
message clear widow black dangerous woman far dangerous anyone ever realized
scar valued life lesson well remember
ackers going kill
main thought kept racing johnnys mind sat class
kept trying push thought kept coming back
realistically ackers lecture brain away melted pile unrecognizable goo
probably one worst forms torture ackers particularly good
thanks technology anywhere anytime
johnny realized thinking tried push mind
brought attention back class
sniders walked around room menacing stare
wearing another one loud polka dot dresses johnny couldnt understand someone wear ugly clothes made stand high degree almost dots varied colors specifically made clash much possible
sniders looked way
johnny best act like paying attention
remembered foul breath didnt want anything call attention bring nearer
already bad enough detention didnt want anything make worse
finally attention wandered students johnny free stop pretending
glanced nancys empty desk
hadnt come school day johnny couldnt help thinking something gone terribly wrong

second thought going johnnys mind competing ackers wanting kill
looked time hour late
johnny started wonder something bad happened
obviously concerned johnny chose go school delivering super chip department
nancy ackers agreed point two joining sides lecture beginning look like crazy nightmare come true
going try take chip house school
johnny couldnt believe
knew working short time trusted enough believe never try anything like
gone along without qualms handing chip got
wouldnt handler whoever want
johnny beginning worry
clunker
johnny shook thoughts see sniders entire class looking
day dreaming
sniders continued
johnny bent low notebook pretended write something
no listening said somewhat pathetically
johnnys mind racing
last thing wanted sniders come close make smell horrid breath
suppose like enlighten answer
sniders asked
great thought johnny never gave break
dont know answer admitted breaking eye contact staring floor
sniders gave exaggerated sigh
seems make habit wasting time
fortunate spending detention time perhaps find way get one track mind right track
sniders went english lesson
johnny shook head going long day
ackers stood outside johnnys front door
looked nervous took frequent quick glances around see anyone watching
preposterous no one knew
ackers tried stop looking place focus task hand compartmentalize step follow goal
glanced next objective getting past front door
likelihood no one home
johnny
fast school dad gone work
lack car driveway confirmed
ackers gave moment pat back acute observational skills
next step bypassing locked door
ackers reached hand tried turn door handle didnt move
definitely locked
course ackers couldnt take granted
things investigated instead assumed knew sure door locked knew exactly proceed
checked driveway make sure car still gone
ackers gave loud sigh stalling knew
glanced around street quickly see anyone saw sigh think place
berated acting foolish amateurish
tried turn handle sure
still locked still no car driveway
enough time get business
ackers took backpack shoulders put ground
zipping open dug series gadgets food rations looking particular device
found brought looked like large thermometer handles
line blue instead red liquid trapped inside see tube
ackers carefully inserted device crack door squeezed looked like blue mercury tube device door
kept squeezing no blue liquid device
got back waited watching stream smoke came door
applied enough liquid bypass locks structural integrity matter moments allowing bend like rubber open door lock returns solid state ackers thought loud
thinking realized presence behind
froze
couldnt believe definitely someone standing behind porch
caught already
happen
united order wasnt supposed know real identities let alone johnny lived
perhaps ackers slipped security somewhere
even possible
ackers slowly turned around see paper delivery boy standing porch mouth hanging open surprise
ackers immediately sprang action using nothing words try confuse misdirect potential assassin

ackers said
boy held paper answer mouth still open looked weird gadget sticking front door
yes thank looking ackers said took paper paper boys hands dropped ground
youre little late arent
isnt supposed delivered first thing morning
morning certainly first thing ackers rambled trying get sort information paper boy confusing time
boy continued stare gadget
ackers sneaking suspicion wasnt assassin
relieved almost fainted right
immediately proud
look well handled situation
course boy nothing civilian really wasnt much situation handle ackers relieved think things
locked house
dont worry situation resolve moment ackers said thinking quickly appear normal possible arouse much suspicion paper boy call authorities
ackers gave front door small push
bolt lock bent like rubber allowed door swing open house
see
back house problem concern ackers said biggest uncomfortable looking smile
almost looked like ackers straining facial muscles spread lips far enough across face
ackers rarely smiled entirely possible muscles atrophied lack use
face started twitching effort keeping lips spread wide enough hold smile
paper boy became slightly alarmed longer stayed ackers
started taking steps back porch
high pitched sound coming somewhere inside house
ackers turned away paper boy peered house
sound
alarm
ackers yelled paper boy soon figured
likely giving thirty second delay enter proper code let computer alarm monitoring station know returned home house live
ackers simply no good thought splendid job putting paper boy ease
anything paper boy probably less alarmed stumbled upon group people wearing masks trying openly burglarize house
paper boy took stumbling step back another ended almost tripping tumbling stairs
ackers turned attention back alarm
stepped inside house went back outside pick paper delivered thermometer gadget used open door
dont want forget ackers held paper called
paper boy hurried away
satisfied done best appear like lived house ackers went back inside slammed door behind
approached alarm keypad emitting noise inspected distance
reached backpack pulled square box keypad front
placed box alarm keypad completely covering started entering random number combinations keypad
worked methodically trying different sorts numbers different orders observing display box typed
soon display told three four numbers correct
ackers didnt much time left alarm go
got fourth number
almost find right order
perfection
job done high pitched noise stopped
ackers slumped wall exhausted
no wonder stayed back base anyone supposed think clearly field distractions
got good look combination numbers used turn alarm
four three two one
kind code
might well left door open
ackers detached keypad box threw lock picking gadget backpack
inside next step finding super chip
found super chip
ackers held hand staring awe
small harmless looking thing yet ackers knew whoever held chip power circumvent worlds technological safeguards
like ultimate skeleton key able open lock
around ackers johnnys room complete mess
ackers turned every moveable item lift dumped contents floor tossed johnnys clothes closet even taken apart johnnys old computer made sure chip wasnt hidden anywhere prehistoric machine
ackers finally found buried bottom closet
knew instantly super chip no hiding amount connections registers chip held ackers ray glasses
ackers took glasses continued stare chip
tear started welling eye one beautiful things ever stared
art perfection ultimate ackers stopped unrestrained admiration
noise
ackers listened intently
someone opening window johnnys room
looking wildly around room ackers spotted place instantly hide
dove desk old computer held breath daring move muscle give chip away
must protect costs safety world depended
well course protect well
world wouldnt want get seriously hurt injured incapacitated way saving
ackers swallowed large lump throat
outside field work really wasnt meant someone important
nancy pried window open dropped lightly johnnys room
looked around disgust unable believe johnny messy appeared
brought hand started keying entry small computer strapped onto wrist
wrist computer started emitting series beeps like sonar
nancy walked around room listening beeps get faster approached different pieces technology
went around room listening series beeps deciding refine search
old computer desk one area alarm clock johnnys bed oddly enough something ceiling attracting devices attention
decided start desk
walked old computer listening beeps got quicker louder
underneath desk ackers frozen wide eyed fear
couldnt see snuck window knew technological radar heard one
listened beeps came closer caught
nancy walked forward holding wrist computer ahead beeps reached frantic pitch
something powerful somewhere around desk
large explosion downstairs rocked house
nancy lost footing grab desk steady
heard sound booted feet running carpet
someone yelling orders
nancy going abort mission compromised
keyed series commands computer turning beeping headed back window
quick look outside told no one covering side house least hoped wasnt
case didnt much else left try escape
nancy dove window
ackers clutched heart fear try stop beating chest
explosion come
going
authorized
no answers questions ackers forced take kind action wait desk caught someone
first order business find room without caught
cautiously spy like ackers peeked desk looked around room
no one sight whoever gone
window still open no trace anyone
ackers heard sound furniture breaking glass shattering downstairs
clearly two different groups breaking steal chip nothing
least clear get without seen either
brought next order business find dealing best deal
words although ackers never admitted way find best get away whoever house
ackers crept door opened crack trying look hallway signs intruders
upstairs completely empty looked like still downstairs
opened door walked quietly banister
ackers looked downstairs
flurry ordered chaos
soldiers destroying everything sight find super chip
barely getting way smashed shot every hiding place find
even walls werent safe blasted laser guns searched holes trace technological wonder ackers clutched tightly hand
opened fist looked simple looking thing
defend knew
risk life put chip using every gadget skill disposal save precious artifact
words probably going die
heroes died defending believed
ackers closed fist tightly resolve strengthened
soldiers turned attention toward stairs leading
ackers shrank back shadows sight
perhaps heroes find way avoid dying still defending beliefs
maybe hiding best thing ackers moment
resolve quickly fading ackers turned bolted back johnnys room softly closing door behind
think something fast going upstairs moment
ackers glanced toward window thought throwing chip outside
wouldnt problem anymore maybe find maybe wouldnt
one thing sure definitely going find kept
no admonished couldnt think like
protect couldnt give
world counting no surrender no throwing away responsibility
like one situation going right thing
ackers held super chip looking resting gently palm
minute going break door ackers thing think
opened mouth wide swallowed super chip
like lump throat moment got stuck ackers choked
fell knees face went red
chip safely stomach
moment ackers hoped stomach acids wouldnt destroy
cursed thinking sooner nothing
ackers struggled back feet faced door
hear soldiers side
time run ackers knew
nothing wait caught
least wouldnt surrender chip couldnt
no matter happened no giving
ackers tried steady nerves breathing kept head high
ready face fate true hero end
nancy watched attack johnnys house safe distance away
partially hidden behind large oak tree much like one zip lined night johnny walked home failed attempt get chip
multiple vans parked sporadically street front johnnys house back doors still wide open army soldiers poured
several still guard around vans keeping watch around neighborhood signs resistance
nancy shook head
like full scale invasion
shown bit earlier probably enough time find chip leave anyone got
nancy brought small device clipped ear
activated two quick taps waited connection established
nice day barely cloud sky
wasnt hot cold perfect weather
youd never know anything bad happening peaceful sunny day
united order got chip back day none ever forget
united order never make mistake letting steal chip back second time
moved super secure location guarded best people technology order afford
use get whatever wanted
build wealth quickly power increase fast
soon people stand soon no one defy openly
unstoppable force upon world
nancy heard series beeps told link established several layers advanced encryptions making almost impossible anyone listen conversation
voice spoke end line said one word yes
voice modulated scrambled making pointless try figure person end line
anyone able break security connection even wouldnt find anything worth knowing
wasnt able retrieve chip
united order showed two dozen soldiers tearing house apart find nancy said continued watch house
end line handler stayed silent
nancy waited knowing handler didnt like interrupted given bad news
nancys handler meant world
handler found two years ago helped train shown make use advanced technological gadgets world ever seen
given enough time nancy probably turn toaster jetpack laser gun radar scrambler
handler also taught fight handle crowds people one one expert martial arts masters
handler given new life away cold foster family orphanage
also given nancy spy name seventy seven identity sense purpose went along
nancy didnt entire organization behind like johnny ackers
one person far nancy concerned enough
might lost chip found

fast suspect anything
handlers voice came line disrupting nancys thoughts
no thinks helping nancy replied
felt guilty deception
nancy liked johnny maybe even wanted admit deceiving like made stomach feel empty hollow
ever forgive
ever forgive
nancy tried push thoughts away handler began speaking
stay house
johnny arrives help
united order gets chip wont much full scale attack
understand nancy replied
connection dropped nancy found alone

chapter still look ways cross street even though nothing left look
no longer running cars left wreck world old habits still remain
child father take firmly hand pause curb
stop ask cars coming
dutifully crane neck peer whatever road
given clear hastily cross street rogue vehicle strike
cars rare arent watch arent left
fuel spare parts long since disappeared
roads crumbling weed choked rubble foot traffic horses rare caravan making use ancients proud achievement
fathers days trail always busy carrying goods
times memory
traders rare number goods scavenged crumbling ruins diminished considerably
everything easy take taken
since no one skill make glorious objects matter time reduced digging dirt sustenance
mere parasites dying world waiting end come
entering paused outside looked home twenty eight years
one hotels left trading trail
like large buildings town ewark made ancients
made hotel different stood three stories high days rarity
anything else taller crumbled away decay becoming yet another ruin scavenged building materials
nonetheless brown brick outside walls repaired many times hardly resembled building remembered childhood
back looked new day made
large parts exterior patched roughly mud no proper bricks left make repairs
father mother cried see looked like
town ewark nothing prominent buildings surrounded number smaller residences made inferior materials
besides hotel mosque calls pray emanated town hall local sharif named faisi ruled open market nothing much left sell general store often empty shelves
desert lived bad farming residents raised half starved livestock made living providing services traveling caravans
days past good living recently decline business
part preferred move north town ever known wanted know
said northern climate cooler cities prosperous
every day someone left city make trek
still hadnt decided
near entrance hotel line nine tethered horses stood hitching post
snorted drank wooden watering trough tails brushing away ever present flies
two soldiers mujadeen resting lazily shaft spears watching horses disinterest
little see town even less unless knew right men
one men find entertainment jaded customer
brothel though woman little interest place wager throwing dice even bar
course places like forbidden holy laws ruled entire world vices always around man no
one soldiers saw
grinned saw small barrel balanced top shoulder
said know landlord possession alcohol strictly forbidden
confiscate unless like lose head
changing expression stopped bowed deeply hard barrel resting shoulder
natural strength task unmanageable
fresh water master lied
fact beer bought friend kalam lived nearby
brewer trade sold select number clientele
product well known upper classes area visiting dignitary want partake
soldier laughed knowingly round belly shaking dirty tunic made roughly knitted wool
spat willing sample called water master
wouldnt want poisoned fall sick
afraid said pushed past
no reason talk two also little reason anger
common soldiers mujadeen underpaid lot least security knowing next meal coming
beer possession cost man life sub vizier staying hotel beyond petty rules
men knew imbibed forbidden liquid everyone given chance
locally one black market sellers beer allowed barely enough coin keep place running
compared heat outside lobby hotel cool haven blazing sun
carpeting underneath feet quite threadbare oak panels dire need repair building still managed cling long forgotten charm older era
placed wall aged grandfather clock broken years ago hands permanently stuck ten minutes five
also paintings faded photographs showing unknown scenes past building people streets crowded cars
loved repair interior former glory like bricks outside no carpenter truly master techniques ancients
hussen recently hired clerk looked impassively front desk passed
man medium build shock black hair always looked unruly brown eyes forever roaming hunting prey
missed old worker pawl recommended cousin take many duties
really no reason complain new mans performance sullen show respect thought deserved
least read write say many residents shrinking town
taking creaky wooden stairs two time climbed third story
took hallway leading best room
dark light coming open window end hall
suppertime candles lit guide customers rooms economy forced rely natural light day
stopped door near end hallway
giving tentative knock door immediately opened thin sergeant wispy black beard
dark eyes looked perhaps checking weapons
important visitor precautions taken
landlord finally arrived said
flung door open let pass
mentioned best room hotel
really two rooms time past combined one
original wall separated two rooms graceful arch ended white column either side
open windows revealed seemingly unending desert outside
two sofas sprawled soldiers busily eating lunch lamb stew maid brought
messy eaters rightfully feared condition fabric worn amazing condition considering age
side room sat sub vizier rasid
resting low chair feet propped edge bed
rasid large perhaps obese man entire region
seems rest working hard stay alive afford luxury large dinner
sherwani jacket turban made finest golden colored silk pants made whitest cotton
richest afford garments since paying rare workmanship prohibitively expensive anyone else
peeking sash wrapped around rotund stomach see butt ceremonial pistol
secret gun lost ever since time ancients
powerful mujadeen power get rare required ammunition
soldiers rest made due swords spears bows
amazing small device kill scores men leaving user free exertion
mikel
rasid boomed
beamed black pointed beard bobbing anticipation beer resting shoulder
glad see
come bring good drink
graciously bowed ingratiating manner since rasid valued customer mine
though visits rare big spender helping provide enough income help keep afloat bare years
drew near black eyes glittered rolls fat made face
years batch turned well
asked licking lips
certainly sir answered
wish tap barrel may sample
nodded watched greedily rested barrel table spiked open
cellar stored beer splashed cold bottom hand
poured golden liquid long tall glass already placed readiness sub viziers visit
smacking lips anticipation rasid took glass hand drank deeply
moment looked glass flecks foam upper lip
said allah correct
best batch yet
someday meet maker fine drink
pour mug men come replenish mine
shall sit talk since much discuss
bid pouring mug beer man
though alcohol forbidden law seem mind
returned rasid refilled empty glass
motioned sit edge bed
rasid leaned squeezed knee sour smell breath hitting nostrils
smiled wanly
tell mikel business
fair replied
rasid squeezed knee one time returning interest back glass beer
took another gulp
trade appear getting better
warlord worried rebels may effect caravans
think
knew rasid reported directly warlord
whatever sub vizier said also interest faraway ruler
shrugged
years trade getting steadily worse
see getting better especially since traders no longer loot ancients cities like
time goes common objects luxury goods get expensive
hurt
stared
think rebels consequence
shook head
never seen one ewark
true
seemed rebellion small little consequence
sometimes men talked mostly humor
commonly thought mujadeen used easy scapegoat
rasids free hand waved across points compass
rebels everywhere
travel roads looking easy prey
magnificent power mujadeen civilization
agree
course agree said bowing head supplication
mujadeen also keeps safe creatures wasteland
fact mujadeen power ever since evil days ancients destroyed
no one imagine world without warlord followers
made laws also enforced iron fist
said warlord governed city washtin mighty army command
simply crush rebels matter speculation
wasnt mujadeen no law
no order world
rebels want
speak freedom no one afford
speak liberty offer nothing chaos
old words mean nothing anymore
kind world promises bring
simple hotel owner replied slowly shaking head
know little politics even less ancient words rebels speak
course speaking truth
though visiting traders spoke rebels no one ever claimed robbed
personally put little stock called rebels since never seen evidence hold countryside
people feared wasteland man
rasid meanwhile laughed fat jowls face shaking mirth
friend succeed regime
care business dont
stability good business answered meekly
good business good
took another sip beer expression hard read
need talk
warlord worried rebels starting gain prominence area
evident enough towns
worries supported populace especially since trade diminishing
hungry bellies soon means land ripe revolution
hungry people willing listen far fetched promises no one possible keep
need people like eyes ears stop rebellion spreading ewark
frowned
sure mean
run business caters travelers
certainly must hear many rumor men stay establishment
pass information great help
attach much importance position said humbly
eyes narrowed becoming near invisible slits
voice became suddenly harsh said think
isnt exactly request
order
say else consequences
command replied quietly
chapter next morning watched sub vizier men rode away
glad see go since like man give orders especially inside hotel
still decline demands since business run
take one word rasid thrown home even put death
unfairness irked no end way world
nothing commanded
days passed summer heat became almost unbearable
like oven inside rooms except blowing sands world outside became still
travelers decided leave visit kalam home
cellar brewed beer kept precious liquid stored away beating rays sun
kalam much older old friend father
actual age unknown rumor great warrior captain mujadeen
pressed information never say thing instead shake head smile
took business death father kalam continued sell illicit alcohol without word
seemed like well enough quiet way
watched kalam carefully measuring hops dark wrinkled hands gently moving cup burlap bag pail
turban covered head held low eyes concentrating task
think ever seen lose single one
gray beard cascaded chin covering front simple cotton shirt
always relaxing watch craftsman work coolness stone floor relief boiling heat outside
kalam man words surprised finally spoke
gravelly voice always low almost incoherent except closest friends
croaked ive heard rasid sub vizier came visit
bought beer mentioned since seem care consumed
trusted enough keep name dealings law
expected without comment since father done
yes replied uncertainly
nodded hair beard bobbing
want
replied cautiously stops hotel least year
part tour province make sure well
nothing unusual
rasid ask anything special
no favors
began wonder asked questions since kalam never shown interest business
voice sharpened replied care
kalam shrugged
no importance
curious
slightly mollified answered spoke rebels growing influence
asked report rumors anything ordinary came way
actually order really
something seems bothering mujadeen
feel
told spy others
like replied honestly
job run hotel spy customers
kalam returned attention back work
said shoulder times changing
old order crumbling like bricks hotel
careful want stay alive
mean
asked
shrugged answer
angrily left kalam letting old man keep mysterious words
entered town
days ewark certainly impressive sight said mighty metropolis days ancients
back supposedly innumerable buildings built dizzying heights network roads mysteriously lit night thousands residents
looking rutted track ran handful low buildings past stories creation fanciful imagination
nothing sand
underneath surface scraps old wreckage occasionally discovered someone digging well repairing foundation
still great city disappeared sands
returning hotel decided replenish larder
store stopped built scant twenty years ago already looked collapse
hardened mud made sides faded years blowing sand thatch roof sagged one side
really good place except open market owner luxury monopoly trade
pushed open wooden door let clang bell mounted frame
inside saw customer
dingy usual two oil lamps providing light except sun shone dimly dusty window
glass counter stretched length store equally dirty cuts meat inside swarming lazy fat flies one reason preferred buy meat local farmer
rest food supplies sadly purchase
mikel
voice rang behind counter
myliss storeowner
skinny shrew woman lank brown hair streaked gray
manner towards always ingratiating heard sharp tongue employees less wealthy customers
good morning said
shall need fifty pounds rice ten pounds butter five loaves bread
also need saffron ginger garlic
sadly shook head
everything butter garlic
give twenty pounds rice
hesitated answering calculating state supplies
going make things difficult
trouble vendors
regular supply caravan late
one week
going start raising prices things get better
shrugged since caravans usually notoriously late
well deliver
make already last little longer
number customers visiting hotel little chance starve death
need payment myliss said normally friendly tone hard unyielding
also need payment last month bill
always pay time replied indignantly
changing terms many years business
expression cold unyielding
asking mikel everyone
get food prices going rise
means costs also going rise
need money pay suppliers make ewark
really bad
grumbled
well return money hand
face softened revealing underlining anxiety
way things going wonder business next year complained
deliveries getting rarer rarer
caravans make complain robbery theft even death
pondered news
always dangerous caravans things never stopped degree
sorry hear myliss
no one complained sharif
job keep province open trade
shook head
made several appeals always tells lacks manpower cover every route
anyways much happens beyond borders province
ive heard word creatures wasteland march
dont take much stock fantasies
theres nothing sand unless believe childish stories
wasteland massive empty desert west
went innumerable miles rumored populated terrible beasts
traders steered clear area roads heading north south still touched borders accursed place
mujadeen supposed patrol areas keeping citizens safe violence
bow left store wondering fresh information meant
chapter summer reaching zenith
days long dusty hot
afternoon front desk hussen going accounts
pencil scratched busily paper read pitiful amounts
recent visit sub vizier enriched pockets business poor
hotel currently unoccupied probably stay way next weeks
rate close months
enough business keep solvent
price food higher ever since everything livestock dependent trade
handful caravans made leaving city practically starving
no one knew happened missing wagons making mysterious
dire thoughts cut short opening front door
walked swarthy man dressed dusty tunic grimy pants black leather boots seen better days
travel worn turban wrapped around head partially undone loose cloth knotted across face protect ever present dust scorching sun
gray eyes stared keenly
room available
asked quiet dignified voice
think might able fit lied manners practiced hotelkeeper
happier rent entire floor
hussen staring dumbly stranger
normally cruel man hussen attitude way bringing worst
fool finally moved kicked squarely rear
get guests bags
shouted
hussen scuttled outside giving malignant glare left
visitor smiled scene modern employee management
said calmly like room northern exposure one lies ground floor
room available
yes arranged
wise choice say
side hotel much cooler time year
please sign register
studied register book moment untying cloth face exposing short cropped beard narrow cheeks
prefer sign
really necessary
looked guest closer wondering balked signing
perhaps enough money stay
law replied firmly hoping scare away potential dodging payment
smiled fine lines around mouth growing prominence
lets say private disposition
willing pay keep privacy
shook head
law everyone must sign ledger else fined
reaching tunic guest reluctantly retrieved leather purse
opened pulling stack gold dinars placed desk
enough pay silence said
abuse trust
lean times no man refuse sight gold
nodding grabbed stack coins pulled towards
moment hussen returned two leather cases hanging arms
eyes followed money disappeared pocket
looked suspiciously back forth stranger
take guest room twelve commanded
yes sir
hussen replied sourly
shuffled new guest tow
called stranger sir dinner served promptly six oclock
tonight chicken rice
come left devices
mysterious guest respond instead disappeared hall
left wondering trying remain concealed
easy enough write false name since wouldnt bothered examine traveling papers
anyways local sharif never came around check register
mystery one going concern
really no reason pry mans affairs
suddenly remembered words sub vizier
interested hear man trying travel roads without leaving trace behind
contact rasid
expect go sharif
gave no instructions situation
merely asked rumors stories passed way point potential troublemakers police
thought salved conscience somewhat
probably nothing report since traders liked remain anonymous fear robbed
pushed thoughts aside returned book keeping
happy small stack gold received since allow stay open little longer planned
perhaps heat reduced autumn travelers take roads
faint hope one
bad wasnt anyone left ewark afford buy business
really want travel cooler north leave everything behind since home ever known
later day finished chores kitchen helping maid molli prepare dinner
see rice bubbling nicely stove oven came delicious smell chicken
stole glance molli looking lovely ever
family almost twenty years started age nine

supped salam began tell story one quite familiar since heard countless times
course everyone since part history sort tale passed father son mother daughter
loud commanding voice salii said countless years ago back oldest grandfather even child age mankind lived sin
people earth creatures beholden outlandish fashions strange addictions life without guidance mohammed allah
immoralities great war came
war ravaged globe destroying life cleansing land flame famine
battle soldiers fought cities burned green pastures turned desert people many lands hunted destroyed
even though playing tai salii stood ancient frame wavering
raised hands voice rising volume
ashes rose mujadeen free sin
might sword took left
mujadeen turned chaos order reshaped world better place
blessed threw sinners made place safe free worst natures
guidance one god
chapter small bedroom located room behind front desk
handy arrival late night guests
kept personal treasures small painting parents original still sealed pack cigarettes times ancients collection antique drinking glasses
perhaps nature business ive always poor sleeper
nonetheless even handicap hear tai leave night
must left window room since hear passing doors lobby
time middle night awoken sound gentle tapping
feeling disorientated opened eyes met pitch blackness shuttered room
sound coming single window looked road yards away
fearing enterprising thief trying gain access inside reached side table retrieved dagger normally hung waist
never cause use ornament expected dangerous days
darkness stole gently window
fling open noise suddenly stopped
opening window quietly possible swung back shutters
light moon see no one standing outside
return slumber heard low moan coming ground
leaning casement saw shadowed body lying resting close foundation

molli whispered
snapped back found outside bedroom window arrow back
hurry kitchen boil water

slowly shook head
even motion took considerable energy accomplish
no doctors
no one must know
well doctor town isnt good fear life receive aid

went desk put dagger
quickly gathered pen scrap paper
brought tai began writing earnestly short cribbed letters
hands shook
amazed strength finish
tai done handed note
closed eyes let long sigh died without word
stood shaking head disbelief
getting wrapped something want part
slowly opened note found read
written unknown language using unfamiliar characters
perhaps coded manner kalam read
thoughts interrupted someone pounding front door
took note tucked fold sleeve
leaving bedroom went lobby listened
sounds coming outside sounded mob trying batter way
since no way treat home angrily strode jerked open door
soon pile five mujadeen soldiers came crashing giving little time dodge
good evening voice said
say good morning
rasid
standing door looking amused clumsiness men
nothing amusing pistol held hand
pointed straight
dark opening barrel reminded blackness death
one twitch finger finished
wondered rasid
thought left city
come said weakly
sub vizier strode imperiously lobby sergeant
interest followed
hussen
grinned malevolently previous meekness replaced arrogance never encountered
second thought emotion always barely concealed behind clever mask
sergeant rasid commanded want place searched top bottom
tear place apart rebel spy found
spoke gun hand never wavered
looking
demanded soldiers scattered look hotel
rasid hussen sergeant remained
rasid spat know looking
hes guest
gave hotel damaged

hes bedroom back
pointed door behind front desk
afraid wont use

hussen snarled
dead replied simply hoping put end matter
sergeant go take look
sub vizier commanded
waited silence sergeant went behind desk bedroom
hussen glared black eyes filled hate
perhaps wanted vengeance past actions
rasids expression remained unfathomable
sergeant returned quickly shaking head
said

man shot rasid said coldly
supposed taken alive
never get information
shrug sergeant said allahs
troubles cast aside heard molli scream
discovered kitchen
pray remain unharmed
knowing manners soldiers doubted
fears soon realized dragged kicking fighting lobby
soldiers gathered around loose circle eyes shiny anticipation
stomach felt sick knowing going happen next
helpless stop proceedings unless wanted shot unwavering pistol rasids hand
knows nothing protested words fell deaf ears
rasid going let men fun
way paying back working far night
started shoving molli around making fall ground picked repeat process
nightgown quickly torn open exposing skin underneath
sight seemed inflame soldiers lust even
soon blood running knees hair wildly disarrayed
sobbing entreaties went ignored

yelled
rasid made motion hand
assault upon molli immediately stopped
fell ground nearly senseless pain shock huddle like wounded animal
said mikel become involved rebels

asked wondering hell talking
rasid stared expression hard calculating
well hussen proceed questioning
make sure kill right away
warlord displeased ferret everything knows
sergeant grabbed arms tried hold
hussen took chance struck hard face
content let situation go hoping realize really nothing rebels
rasid appeared worried head
kill meant saving life
ever since small boy warned keep temper check always quick anger
self control kept violent emotions bay
let go
vision receded red haze
felt skin crawl rage
even rasids pistol trained didnt care
going die let said died honor
easily shook free skinny sergeant swinging around struck head fist
went sprawling wall mighty bone splintering crash
traitor hussen grabbed neck squeezed
eyes went wide shock
swung bodily front desk
ancient wood cracked body hit frightful impact
fell ground scream agony
turning attention rasid saw moved
face remained impassive infernal gun still pointing
took step towards hands stretched grab thick throat
no one beat bullet said sneer
caring took another step
flick wrist rasid fired
tried hopelessly dodge
bullet hummed ear striking wall next
another step hissed
dont want kill
least yet
still answer questions
anything else blow struck back head
entire world began spin vision began fade
another blow knees
ill never know hit ended saving life
couldnt rush rasid take blasted gun away
consciousness faded away felt body go limp hit floor
seemed like second
heat intense
body ached worse head
felt sliding across floor like sack potatoes
every ounce faded strength opened eyes
took moment realize surrounded fire
smoke thick grey
closed eyes wondering descended hell
panic opened eyes pulled head floor see pulling
energy nearly made pass
saw kalam expression grim
swam darkness world became nothing
chapter awoke find shivering cold
rag draped forehead frigid water dripping hairline
body knot pain
sickening lurch remembered everything recently happened
felt numb wondering happened molli

chapter horse given old brown haired nag seen better days
least gait across desert smooth helped pain bruised battered body
except drum hoof canteen clattering belt held sword quiet
bags rolled blanket bow hanging behind cinched uncomfortably close saddle
freely admit no horseman since rarely needed rely service living ewark
also no warrior
never need weapons depend brute strength handle trouble
setting moon full making strange long shadows desert land
cast glance shoulder eastern horizon still see glow burning hotel
never left home
felt wrong leave ewark fools errand choice
stayed eventually discovered killed mujadeen
flee north city feared rasids reach long
no safety
kalam given horse water bedroll enough food see next days
coded note tai hidden inside inner pocket jacket
kalam also given directions rebel town along roughly drawn map
according instructions go around lake supri enter wasteland
traveling find entrance low rocky valley river flowed
valley pointed mountains rebels like long dagger
matter traveling valley mountains beyond
journey seemed easy enough provided mutans let pass
advice received kalam dealing mutans simple direct
see mutan run hide since strong taste flesh man
no reasoning dont stop try
traveling horse able make valley one night mutans abide world without sun
best stay city ruins since numerous
stay close southern wall trail
safe enough provided use wits
mutans creatures legend sort nightmare used scare little children
never seen one many stories travelers stayed hotel told ferocious manlike creature killed pleasure
traders dared explore depths wasteland never seen
chance
shook head thought wondering fate put dire position
no choice make best
rode another hour sound desert unbroken except passing
thought molli unfair died
also thought mother father disappointed
doomed live poverty squalor misunderstanding mujadeen
still wanted no part called rebellion cursed kalam involving
refused room tai
passing thoughts broken neigh horse
leaned petted neck trying quiet old girl
perhaps sensed danger
looked ahead saw nothing
however sense ease quickly disappeared heard behind galloping unknown number horses
everyone knew mujadeen patrolled area protect denizens wasteland
caught soldiers surely questions answer
kicked flank mare bolted ahead
really no idea long horse last since nothing old nag
surprise speed considerable took whatever limited skills stay back
hands held tightly bridle aching thighs stayed cinched around sides heaving flanks
rode way deserted plain along no idea close pursuers
afraid turn look since lost balance
ahead make long dark shadow stretched length horizon
lake supri
better going end caught
suddenly limited light moon saw arrow fly strike sand ahead
without even thinking turned head look pursuers
barealy stayed mount
hundred yards away least dozen men horseback steeds pressed forward chase
horror mujadeen soldiers quickly gaining stirring streaming trail dust went
leaning forward kicked hard flanks poor horse
responded another burst speed tell old girl beginning tire sure footing becoming clumsy breathing ragged exhaustion
wasnt going last much longer rate
behind sun starting rise
night heading roughly southwest hoping strike edge lake
right front
hundred yards away
beyond body water lifeless wasteland
horse stumbled slowed canter
another arrow sped past followed another half dozen
missed plowed sand ahead
looked shoulder found pursuers speed also slackened
fifty yards behind surprise looking another horseman galloping towards right
man dressed long black robe riding equally black horse
hands waving air motioning soldiers stop
surprise pursuers slowed pace
hit edge lake sun shimmering still blue water
another glance showed mujadeen soldiers stopped
one talking robed stranger others watched rode waters edge
let horse slow walk along pebble strewn shoreline
continued glance soldiers wondering press attack
horse tired continue forced stop dismount
keeping wary eye pursuers let mare drink lake
lather old rag began wipe
soldiers wheeled mounts around began slowly riding away
rider black stared momentarily features indistinct distance following others
mystified behavior since still within bow range
didnt strike chance
let horse rest
continued drink lake ate yellow grass growing along shoreline
sat slumped sand watching small waves water
rising sun beat shoulders
afraid say fell asleep
pain shock night much
no energy left continue
chapter awoke find sun blazing overheard scorching sand around without mercy
position tell time mid afternoon
face felt red raw exposure
throat also aching thirst took long drink canteen
chided foolishly falling asleep since lost valuable traveling time
mare near shore lake head drooping drowsily
body ached got see
gently rubbed nose
whinnied appreciation rocking head back forth
youre good horse said soothingly
alive
filled canteen lake
pulled onto mare gently prodded forward easy pace
perch saddle finally see wasteland detail
though first looked like desert different minute ways
unlike land traversed no life single bird flew sky ground free occasional lizard snake
also free vegetation without single cactus joshua tree seen
rode along found wasteland also deathly quiet wind horse breaking oppressive silence
felt entered graveyard
even heat baking sun shivered unknown fear
nightmare stories place suddenly become real
shaking bad feeling pulled map kalam provided
looks head north west hit opening valley
headed far north miss entrance together run walls valley strayed far west lost desert
sadly compass sun
kalam warned dangerous descend valley using walls find entrance
sides valley steep treacherous made impassable horse man alike
traveling across length desert also impossible since enough water carried supply man horse
fresh water somewhere deep valley route take
rode time sun slowly dropped west burning bright eyes
night came northern star became navigation
already rested day continued chill night
living desert long immunized rapid temperature difference night day still wished brought along something warmer wear
leftover heat sun dissipated sand ended using wool blanket cover head body
riding silence desert unsettling experience
beyond sound horse hooves striking sand squeak saddle nothing
felt like sailor lost sea alone forgotten rest world
unchanging rhythm noise started lull sleep causing eyes droop weariness
soon found sleeping several times moment unconsciousness broken head slumping forward hitting mane horse
tired continue finally slid horse fell heap cool desert floor
went sleep
feeling something warm nuzzle ear awoke start
mare brown eyes looking mine
sun high turning ground furnace
getting drank water sharing meager resource horse
quick breakfast jerked meat saddle looking signs valley entrance
know caused look shoulder perhaps nature wasteland made one cautious shimmering waves desert floor thought saw dark figure riding behind
looked like stranger stopped soldiers pursuing
pulling reins halted mare take better look man
time see anything since distortion heat across sand made everything look like waving black ocean
still shake thought followed
however rode along checked shoulder never saw figure appear
hours later noticed black smudge horizon ahead slightly left intended direction
continued recognized blackness smoke rolling high sky
something large burning
started ride way
perhaps loneliness idle curiosity foolishly decided investigate cause fire
better minded business
expanse smoke grew larger stride mare
came closer source slowed walk
no reason incautious wasteland since mutan trap unnatural phenomenon
ridge ahead smoke billowing behind
along ridge several footprints indentations sand large group laid wait
dismounted mare cautiously made way across burning sand
upon closer inspection footprints oddly shaped
certainly looked like no animal ever seen
much like foot man narrow
toes also left long scratches sand indicating sort claw
disturbing sight soon forgotten looked ridge
line dozen burning wagons
voluminous cargo space looked like sort wagons used traders
no signs owners even horses pulled
goods inside scattered across desert floor
gulped nervously tingle fear crawled spine
looked mutans attacked caravan happened people horses
decided best move discovered
ran horse practically leaped onto saddle
grabbing bridle kicked flanks went gallop
looking behind saw nothing warrant haste feeling fear still stayed
really expecting much poor beast grudgingly decided slow canter
right saw little gully dipped desert floor
since no signs tracks decided take way precaution remain unseen potential observer
feeling smug decision ridden ten feet gully suddenly front sand exploded
no chance react knew hidden net lifted ground
wrapped mare immobilizing movement forward
horse neighed terror started kick buck
mesh net covering face panic beginning rise
rolled side freeing saddle stirrups
falling open side net find lying face gulley bottom free trap sprung
jumped feet eyes greeted horde vicious creatures rushing
everything moving quickly
little time examine mutan features wicked black blades enough decide next move
tug unfamiliar sword ripped scabbard hanging belt
clumsily swung blade closest beast splitting misshapen skull two
blood came black night
killing nothing stop mutans continuing attack
swung another blade struck home never saw killed foul creature overwhelmed sheer numbers
anything else tripped soon covered mass bodies
fetid stench worse ewark trash pit
still fought trying leverage strength superior numbers
nothing soon blow head stopped struggle
passed
chapter pain filled haze awoke start wishing head stop used receiving end everyones frustrations
wrists hurt hands felt numb
peeled eyes open sticky sweat sand find looking fire blackened skull close face
eyeless sockets stared accusingly guilty predicament
sick smell burnt breakfast thick air
felt bile rise throat
looking blurrily around surroundings found tied rusty metal pole arms hanging head
pit contained nothing ashes
craning neck left right saw pit twenty feet long five tall poles like mine
pole remnant something human burned scraps bone flesh
stomach recoiled revulsion realized people eaten foot
struggled bonds without effect
finally looked saw three mutans sitting sand front pit
chance study extra detail little help quaking heart
hideous creatures coarse hairless grey skin black eyes malformed faces almost looked human grotesque extreme noses slits mouths lipless revealing rows pointed yellow teeth
short stature like boy twelve summers
no clothing except roughly made belt hold sword quiver arrows
short bows lying sand
wondered perversion allahs allowed evil things exist
mutans talking garbled language stopped notice struggles
barking laughs got approached pit swords drawn
one stepped closer mouth spreading wicked smile nothing wall rotted teeth
flick wrist blade tucked chin
feel sharp tip jabbing windpipe
croaked protest careful move
blade dug deeper allowing trickle blood escape mercifully dropped
let gasp relief
please pleaded dont kill
cackled appeals
ringleader goaded cruel laughter time sword sliced tunic flesh underneath
gritting teeth felt hot blood began drip chest past stomach
head beat hard pain swimming red color
mutan thankfully pulled sword away
breathed hard rivulets sweat dripped forehead
stop screamed
brought laughter tormenters
instead using sword mutan front began motioning hands
pain wracked vision appeared miming making fire
suddenly dawned aimed cook like poor victims caravan
shook head fearing dreadful pain fire licking feet legs
knew hurt worse anything ever experienced
one mutans dug ground behind
large basket soon uncovered revealing coal like substance
help friends began ferrying contents pit legs
nothing watch scream fearing moment set fire
even though no one help began praying allahs divine intervention
no one came
tinderbox produced
scrapes flint later mutan cheery blaze going scrap wood
sheltering tiny flame hand walked pit set black fuel fire
looking see little fire spread
minute heat already heating booted feet uncomfortable degree
delight mutan started screaming time swearing tormenters
flames quickly spread heating feet legs hot piercing tongue pain ran length body
began moan cry agony
tears welled eyes blurriness saw one mutans suddenly collapse ground clutching neck frightful shout
fighting intolerable pain managed open eyes look
another one immediately fell arrow sticking bare back
remaining creature ran bow late
arrow struck leg causing mutan fall ground unworldly cry
saw shut eyes scream pain caused licking flames
able open eyes saw lithe figure standing wounded mutan
girl
took knife neatly cut creatures throat
help
called let another scream pain
suddenly intensity fire began abate
opening eyes saw standing front kicking burning coal side pit
even pain induced fog saw pretty thing short cropped hair narrow cheekbones thin girl like body flawless ebony skin
clothing simple tunic pair pants almost color sand
soon felt bonds part fell forward ground
heat sand felt cool face compared burning fire experienced
need water said bluntly
voice rougher beauty no mood debate merits either
turning saw bending face expressionless
eyes blue sky

asked ragged breaths needing know name savior
name suvan replied simply
mikel gasped
without word took water skin belt handed
shaking hands removed stopper took drink warm leathery water
felt wonderful
think walk
asked casting glance shoulder
know
feet hurt badly
little sympathy voice replied
better try
much longer friends come back
want happens
horse said
easier ride
shook head
afraid already dead
mutan hate horses even men kill sight
come weve wasted enough time talk
time move
helped ground grip surprisingly strong thin body
soon stumbling alongside step bringing new wave pain
already felt dizzy exhaustion wondered much longer go
saw taking well trodden path already heavy tracks mutan
going way
asked irritably
going run whole pack foul creatures
sighed exasperation
went straight across fresh part desert tracks obvious
way confuse followers
clever admitted
know much ways
talk much replied impatiently
stay quiet safe
much answer questions
soon reached flat rocky outcropping turned path
suvan stepped onto stony surface motioning follow
hard surface rock much feet compared softness sand
every step pure agony
suvan reached end stony surface dropped back desert floor
jolt pain making grunt
shady surface rock sat thankfully taking weight feet
take boots suvan gently grabbed shoulder
said know hurts wait little longer
want wait darkness comes move
better remain prepared
wouldnt want run mutan bare feet
youre full wisdom retorted harshly
exactly
ignoring sharp words said choose live
no choice matter
suddenly feeling foolish childish outburst said
still looking edge rock presumably checking remained hidden potential pursuers
suddenly dropped haunches sat next
kept voice low started tell story
father named aseik well known scout traders
use crumbling maps found many lost cities earning fee merchants
dangerous work since visit uncivilized parts far safety mujadeen guarded roads
turn traders took risk scavenging cities valuables contained within
number new cities discovered dwindled zero
came decline trade
traders still looking new sources wealth hoping large cache refill coffers
father came wasteland
asked
nodded
always rumors great city lying sands wasteland
father came investigate thinking stories untrue still worth risk
discovery large city filled coffers long time

smiled wanly
mother died young

gave easy smile
nothing like little misunderstanding
ive heard free men live safely inside vast tracts wasteland

suvan looked intently

surprised told go way
mean certain death
doesnt seem safe place anywhere damn land
afraid dont much choice
frowned reminded bad memory
father died valley

able escape father died hail mutan arrows

lucky arrived time unlike others filled bellies mutan
said gratefully drawn smoke fell trap
glad found time
tell willing lead valley entrance
afraid lost
looking darkening sky said sun setting soon
buy safety

chapter suvan taking lead traveled night
walked sand careful confident manner using stars guide
setting sun temperature dropped making wish lost provisions blanket
feet still bothering pain dull instead relentless throb
suvan prospects surviving journey looking better
stroke luck hoped meant better days coming
arent worried running mutan
asked whisper came crest dune
snorted
afraid dark
return camp huddle around fires like little children
perhaps see well night
course plenty dangers beyond mutans
best always stay toes
like sort dangers
asked
mutans bad enough
darkness make shrug
something strange land something alien forbidding
breeds evil
valley ive seen plants eat flesh
also seen unholy creatures inhabit darkest corners ruined city
ive traveled many lands father years never seen anything like accursed place
neither
hours walking dark menacing clouds began blanketing sky
sight suvan motioned stop
began digging big sweeping motions sand bare hands
come help demanded

making place rest day
need stay sun also remain undiscovered mutan scouts
like go rain coming prefer stay dry
also need take boots tend burns become infected
direction dug pit two feet deep approximately length height
knapsack brought sand colored tarp stretched hole
four long stakes driven corners keeping tarp flat desert floor
started rain water coming heavy drops
suvan crawled carrying pack
come rain take boots said voice muffled sand tarp
shrug slid inside
dark
taking boots busy fidgeting something knapsack
suddenly spark little flame flickered stub candle
said rain good since cover tracks
sit back let take look feet
requested feeling self conscious attention
yank sent pain shooting legs suvan slid socks pulled back pant legs
let low whistle

asked
replied concern feet legs terribly blistered
much right
better get sleep keep feet open air

stomach audibly grumbled
suvan laughed dug knapsack
said handing small thin strips jerked meat
started eating found taste rather different

asked bites
many animals live desert
lizard killed day
made face belly didnt care
finished small meal took swig water skin
suvan put lamp
shut eyes tried sleep aware young woman lying next
rain outside increased intensity drowning noise
rolling side put back hoping feel uncomfortable sharing tight space total stranger
surprise draped arm around waist
hand soon found way shirt fingers began playfully rubbing stomach
pleasant sensation still felt acutely uncomfortable
turning face whispered thought said needed get sleep
kissed gently lips making pull back inches
ive lonely whispered back huskily
hard turn obvious invitation
understand replied softly kissing back
lips cool remote
tell many women
replied kind question time like
due proximity feel shrink back
ive never anyone
ive never chance
tremble started shoulders went length body
put arms around suvan
resist
said gently years ago woman meant lot
thinking poor molli
shes dead
no others
old replied
teenager parents died unknown disease ravaged town
death forced take family business
isnt much time dallying local maidens youre busy running hotel
well show know
voice quavering nervousness
even though exhausted events day proceeded make love
inexperienced fumbling quickly became confident
entered wrapped arms around neck gently moaning ear
tight confines pit dug made interesting positions stop satiated
done fell asleep wrapped arms
smiled surprised recent turn events
stayed hiding place rest night next day
rain disappeared allowing scorching sun return fury
spent time eating sleeping exploring others bodies
wasnt sun set suvan broke camp started guide entrance valley
chapter night
hours hard traveling came entrance valley
moonlight see ground gradually sloping downward ending opening two massive stone slabs
compared open space desert looked like trap
felt nervous
swallowed hard trying force lump throat
suvan handed water skin
sorry offer anything said regretfully
hefted weight water hand
survive without
shrugged motion blur darkness night
water back little camp spare bow sword
afraid unprotected mutans numerous monsters reside within valley
figure something said bravely
grabbed arm squeezed tightly
please dont go
return camp
ill take somewhere away reach mujadeen
together
shook head
mujadeen control everything wasteland mountains beyond
get want continue live
even run another town always danger mujadeen recognize
hand dropped arm
said coldly stream valley look
mutan mostly stay together larger ruins dangers must worry
stay close cliff walls dont anything foolish
knowing say bent gently kissed cheek
respond instead pulled back
said haltingly thanks saving life
suvan turned started walk away
said shoulder go hell
respond took run soon disappeared shadow nearby dune
moment stood
ready face unknowns city yet
anyways already missed suvan
though known short time liked forwardness beauty
wondered ever see
stomach grumbled reminding must find food soon
heavy heart started walking slope entrance valley
sand see deep paths cut treading numerous mutan feet
wondered kalam rebels made since mutan seemed everywhere
still made journey least gave hope survival
valley floor flat progressed walls rose higher higher sky
suddenly stopped amazed saw
sides several large black alien creatures slowly inching across stony surface valley sides
distance darkness make details thought new creeping horror unsettled whatever calm
walked ground began widen
feet partially covered sand road built ancients
broken pot holed still recognized uniform construction direction
shoulders ancient street curious mounds rather large size
approached one cautiously found lumps made hollowed metal rusted dirty
wondered purpose served
perhaps used storage understand placed close road
dawned cars vehicle ancients father told
days practically gone since fuel keep running long disappeared
wondered running vehicles inside city
amazing find thing drive
interest cars disappeared soon saw ruin ahead
wasnt much building realization something watching within
full fear cautiously approached destroyed building half expecting mob mutans pour shattered doors
however anxiety unfounded since nothing left ancient walls twisted metal
remains gloomy interior see nothing wreckage whatever building held
thick layer sand covered floor
sign flaking red paint written letters coded note carrying
gave food thought perhaps learn secret language
continued dark road cars buildings started become numerous
awe ancients
civilization built much destroy
seemed impossible knowledge power disappear leaving dust rusted remnants
anything proved folly mankind aspirations
everything build loved someday gone
dark thoughts interrupted noise left
faint sound metal grating metal
another building
roof collapsed ages ago leaving nothing jumbled wreck rusting steel broken concrete
however foundation still intact black empty square indicating window stood
suspecting mutan activity silently crept direction building
left road boots began kicking dirt covered glass shards remnants windows destroyed building
even though valley far sparse vegetation noticed ground around ruin completely devoid plants
impulsively stopped feeling unsure
something definitely wrong place
around right ankle sudden squeeze violent pull
react fell onto back knocking air lungs
heart raced panic realized slowly dragged along ground towards foundation building
looking saw pulled something looked like thick black rope wrapped tightly around ankle
pressure hard feel foot going numb
reached tried unloop rope around ankle
touched rope shuddered disgust scaly unnatural warmth
realized alive
unknown monster trying pull inside ruin
kicked struggled still break grip
wished sword
left foot began pushing tentacle grip increased intensity
healing burns sudden burst pain caused scream
left foot hit something solid
foundation building
hole length tentacle disappeared inside
smell strong stench rotten flesh
bracing free foot concrete foundation pushed strength whatever terrible creature trying devour
locked knee strength tentacle redoubled
gritted teeth fighting keep getting drawn inside
grip ankle momentarily loosened
thought moment win inhuman strength hope vanished another tentacle emerged hole
watched horror second appendage ran along edge foundation almost like searching whatever impeding entry creatures lair
moment ankle found pulling began anew
shut eyes strained impossible strength
strength fading quickly
vain cried allahs mercy
suddenly heard swing blade slicing air
opened eyes saw suvan striking taut tentacles sword
two quick hacks free
ruin came horrific squealing made ears ring
began scrambling away thankful miraculous reprieve
fetid hole burst dozen tentacles flailing randomly chance strike attacker
suvan stepped back foot foot sword began making practiced crisscross pattern deadly blade slicing appendage strayed close
face grim panic creature pressed attack
since weapon took chance run
stumbled back road
suvan reach walked calmly join
said disdainfully couldnt leave less hour got trouble
men insufferable
face burning shame smiled broadly suvan glad
chapter dawn approaching glimmer sunlight shining cliff wall
pulling arm suvan led road small ruin
one time must shed structure collapsed leaving nothing tangle debris
part metal roof still intact lying side half covering hole ground
last experience took step backwards pit unsure horror resided within
come suvan said impatiently
completely safe
ive stayed many times
slipped headfirst metal disappeared inside
trepidation joined
found uncomfortable cavity barely enough room two sit
smell dust decay
enterprising spider work leaving mass grey cobwebs got hair
rest suvan said
anyways going daylight soon
mutans force
said youve
made face
told no water wasteland
times must return city get
ive hidden stay sight mutans
nodded
tell creature attacked
shrugged
know care know
evil
lucky came along save
alright lied
laughed softly
doubt
told dangerous valley go walking road like place
told stay outskirts valley yet go investigate anything strikes fancy
dont listen
afraid dont know better since new sort life admitted
besides ive never ewark
work ancients fascinates no end
sigh suvan shook head
suppose used buildings artifacts
hold no interest except profit bring
youll get used time
tell city worth time scavenge
yes mutans strong
take army dislodge city
no merchant take pay number mercenaries needed undertaking
father already written possibility regretfully died leaving last time
stared
come back city
question took suvan surprise
hard time meeting eyes finally replied
came back help
couldnt leave die
touched reached put hand
angrily pulled arm back freeing clasp
thats fool

asked exasperation
way father died
way traders butchered
cant let happen anyone else
mutans must allowed another victim
try get sleep
chance get rest still long way go
said nothing instead closed eyes almost immediately dropped fitful sleep
soon morning came flooding valley light sun
hiding place see mutans using nearby road
hundreds one armed sword bow
paid no attention hiding place instead marching east towards entrance valley
going
asked suvan shaking arm
eyes fluttered open
answered sleepily raid plunder anyone crosses wasteland
beyond
surely no one comes far wasteland
saw burned wagons traders
often come northwest hoping save time cutting across wasteland
think raiding
mean
explained villages towns edge wasteland
mutans raid food
also easy pickings along roads caravans use
least thats heard
shuddered idea

asked

asked annoyance
mean mutans course
arent human exist expanse wasteland
come
shook head said impatiently say like living evil place warped humanity
perhaps hideous leftover days ancients
perhaps cursed allah
doesnt matter
right suggest get sleep since long night hiking ahead
watch
tried sleep
though suvan thought hiding place never discovered still felt exposed
tossing turning finally fell asleep dreaming old bed back destroyed hotel
stuffed feathers soft
wasnt bed like ewark
awoke suvan shaking shoulder
snore said grumpily
thought mutans going discover sound alone
sorry replied sleepily
turn watch said
wake see anything coming way
sky clear one openings see almost dozen strange creatures climbing wall
things seen last night
disgusting
long bodies thick antennae looked like giant black six foot long crickets crawling motion reminded nothing like jumping insect
saw creatures cliff walls last night
asked suvan trying find comfortable position
harmless replied crossly obviously tired questions
feed lichen walls
seen mutans hunt food
stop asking many questions let shut eyes
watch started mid afternoon
stood post kept eye road
stifling inside hole iron sheet soon grew hot touch
boring watching little
sun finally started wane noticed nearby mutan foot traffic began decrease
however twilight came sudden inrush mutans coming direction valley entrance
returning home
chapter dark fell mutan disappeared sight
gently awoke suvan yawned loudly opening eyes
silently ate meal dried lizard meat finishing last water skin
wasnt much meal beginning hunger something else
rations like become thin knife
shall get water commented afterward
little distance
lead way said
crawling hole began walking along outskirts ruins
see towering wall side valley
walls widening making wonder exactly large valley
ruins numerous crowding closely together maze rubble filled streets roads numerous remnants cars also seen rusted metal pitted time
suvan moved cautiously silent ghost
eyes searched along crooks crannies debris
gloom night saw distant circle flickering light ahead
suvan also saw motioned drop back behind
crept silently along empty quiet buildings company
progressed light grew larger larger
roaring fire clearing next collapsed ruin
front blaze score huddled mutans resting haunches
hurriedly hid behind wrecked car
mutan outpost suvan whispered ear
theyre setup various spots city
bother
replied
expect attack
shook head
understand behavior
still get around without seen
go city bypass easily enough
take risk close
going city night wise choice said harshly
unsafe
things far worse tentacled horror almost ate

cause distraction go
meanwhile run across meet side
rusted bridge another four hundred yards
sits water need
suitable place wait
certainly brave though idea foolish
said appreciate willingness sacrifice shall make past together
no fighter said mockingly
give sword show retorted
sigh suvan reluctantly drew sword handed
darkness looked curved blade felt unfamiliar weight steel hand
no swordsman willing kill meant saving life
already killed two mutans
needed
let move said trying sound braver felt
taking bow shoulder suvan adjusted quiver arrows waist
nod head began silently leading ruined avenue
buildings still standing majority fallen choking street debris
progressed saw corner eye flame mutan fire growing brighter
soon low ruined wall separated
hear strange garbled language
suvan moved silently like cat
footsteps sounded loud boots slipped rough ground
elbow accidentally struck nearby wall
suddenly ancient brick clattered fell heavily paved ground reverberating echo
suvan suddenly stopped
nearly ran
stood still holding breath
low talk amongst mutan ceased
shadows see suvan slowly turn face
forefinger hovered lips signaling silence
stood motionless even daring breathe
guttural bark rang hear motion feet heading direction
suvan quickly tugged hand taking sprint
followed suit caring time heard
burst past wall open street
suvan fast runner quickly gaining ground
turning head saw four mutans coming behind
wicked blades glinted weak light moon
picked pace running hard
seconds felt lungs going burst
living comfortable life long kind adventure
mutan camp barrage arrows suddenly passed head
ahead heard suvan give scream
dropped ground writhing pain
catching stopped found lying face arrow sticking right calf
desperately trying pull wedged tightly flesh
darkness fresh blood ground looked black
saw turned face attackers
rushed swords held high malicious leer pasted twisted alien faces
held sword ready
clang steel attacked
swords clashed together
force combined blows made stagger back step
one tried go low lunging blade mid section
sheer luck managed twist away unharmed
taking another step back lunged closest attacker
blade struck mutan fully chest blade penetrating almost hilt
twist arm went agonizing scream
combatants even hesitate upon seeing death comrade instead took chance press attack
air alive swinging blades
took strength whatever little skill keep remaining attackers bay
every step took backwards took closer suvan
allow happen
took chance decided attack
wide arcing sweep blade caught one mutan unaware
blade cleaved deeply creature forearm making drop weapon ear splitting howl
behind heard twang arrow released suvan bow
arrow sunk deeply throat another attacker leaving one standing
remaining mutan showed no concern compatriots
also showed no fear continued violently swing sword aiming head
parried blow used superior strength push back step
though weaker still incredibly fast
sword suddenly slipped downwards breaking contact blade trying plunge upward breast
long reach gave scant time turn away fatal strike
move mutan left exposed
since close use sharp end sword instead used hilt rap remaining mutan hard head
immediately sprawled ground unconscious
mikel
suvan shouted voice wracked pain
turned found sitting bow hand
mutan arrow still stuck deeply leg
immediately reached pull
said impatiently never mind
get moving mutans come way
wont go far beyond light bonfire
chance escape
shoved sword belt picked suvan
grunt draped shoulder started trot forward
looked lighter felt
soon lost darkness ruins
following suvans whispered directions presently found standing narrow footbridge rusted dark years
underneath feet hear slow gurgle passing water
crossed ancient causeway looked saw narrow stream moon shining moving water
bridge led path choked small trees thick weeds
safe
chapter morning come
suvan sleeping tarp head resting weeds
last night pulled arrow calf even let whimper
knew screamed like baby
afterward bound wound tightly extra rag knapsack
little hope mutan arrow tip poisoned
without word fallen fitful sleep ran hand gently along back petting cat
took moment reconnoiter
sword hand began following edge thin stream
one time must large river since ancient sandy banks still evident
middle water see hulk small sailboat half buried stream bed
shore side row ruined buildings empty windows staring silent foreboding
quiet still felt watched
walked along meandering bank depleted river saw path water curving
perhaps small island
minutes suspicions turned correct came back bridge first crossed last night
followed path inwards found suvan left
still sleeping since mutans still nowhere seen decided take time investigate interior
trees weeds grew thicker forming natural wall trespassers
rabbit jumped underbrush ran sight reminding still hadnt eaten morning
getting tired dried lizard thought fresh rabbit stew made mouth water
ignoring rumbling stomach pressed forcing way tangle branches using sword cut bramble
dozen feet weather stained concrete wall standing twice height ending top flat roof thick growing plants
length wall went twenty feet broken three small windows
remarkably glass still intact glazed grime
peering inside see anything darkness
continuing onward slashed undergrowth
followed edge wall got corner
entangled branches lessened able progress less hindrance
found another wall wide metal door set wall
miracle door still white even though no sign paint
hard rap knuckles revealed hollow space behind metal saw no obvious means egress
frustrated continued examination side building
beyond metal door another corner
went past found large attached concrete building series unbroken dirty windows set steps led regular sized door
place looked like home certainly unlike house ever seen
enormous two stories high must belonged wealthy man long dead
felt like trespasser tomb
wanting break windows gain entry climbed stairs tried door
locked
door made rust free material put shoulder hard
hinges pulled easily away wooden frame door fell inside crash causing plume dust rise floor
dim inside enough light see
cautiously entered feeling pay respects dead
floor covered thick inch dust ceiling hung thick tapestry cobwebs
hanging across windows moth holed remnants curtains light outside dimmed years dirt
also sofa legs collapsed floor two chairs faced dusty gray panel attached wall
opening across front door led another room
apart natural decay time house still looked remarkably intact
concrete construction closed egresses elements never chance destructive work
deciding good place hole suvan chance heal returned
found awake looking apprehensive sound footsteps saw
thought left whispered weakly
looked fondly
girl saved life
apologize said trace embarrassment

think fight fought four mutans won
shrugged
nothing
anyway little help
get ground heal
found house stay
looked perplexed
house
island
hidden undergrowth
remarkably good shape intact roof
good place rest ready go
island get water never suspected house
neither anyone else
hotel never seen intact building ancients
even furniture inside use
eyes alive curiosity
take demanded
gently picked suvan cradling arms
rested head shoulder breathing quick shallow
carefully carried house vainly trying keep branches striking
inside spread tarp ruined sofa placed top
suvan looked room eyes wide marveled artifacts
visits cities ive never seen home ancients looted ruined
miracle escaped notice long
perhaps builder place made way purpose
good fortune
dont think mutans even know place
chapter suvan rested sofa started carefully explore rest home
front room next place examine kitchen
dirty ceiling mounted light covered gray dirty cobwebs
lifeless light dusty glass table surrounded four chairs
hallway carpeting left closed door wood right
recognized sink stove cupboards make sense objects
large metal box big enough fit two shoved wall
chrome handle gently pulled no result
harder tug door released grip time
inside boxes containers labeled strange blocky writing
also faint odor decay reminded sour milk
whatever material contained long rotted away turned dust
returning interest cupboards found nothing inside plates glasses carcass dried centipede
drawers turned blackened spoons knives forks
next tried door right
opened easily enough rusted hinges barely protesting movement
large room second ingress outside metal door stymied
inside area nothing jumble hoses gardening equipment wooden handles looking dried fragile
returning kitchen ventured hallway four doors two side
first door practically fell apart opened
small narrow room two sinks bathtub caked dust
fragments mirror scattered floor countertop
next room door already open
one time bedroom
curtains hanging window nothing tattered scraps remnants large bed still occupied
lying moth eaten covers mummified remains person
skull empty sockets stared sightlessly ceiling
body shriveled hideous gray reminding mutan covered moth eaten rags
clutched flesh stripped hand object easily recognized pistol
wrenching gun death grip host no easy matter soon possession
disappointment metal long rusted away
pointing gun wall tried pull trigger expecting old magic still exist nothing happened
disappointed threw gun back bed continued
room also bedroom empty except decayed furniture
last door led stairway heading upwards
suvan
called hall
yes mikel
ghost voice answered front room
havent found anything yet headed upstairs take look around
call need anything
dont gone long said
place starting scare little bit
took stairs cautiously step creaking ominously aged wood protested sudden weight body
stairs ended large room took entire second story
one time must beautiful place walls back house nothing glass
even ceiling row glass windows covered decayed flora rested roof
trees growing close house making outside light turn green shone canopy leaves
vision rippling fauna see two wooden easels paintings long ago faded away
walls paintings nothing faint images
also remnants sofa nearby long box brass ends
box immediately drew attention since except dust remarkably good condition
walked slowly floor creaking uncertainly
got knees examine box closely
sleeve dusted found box heavily covered green paint yellow lettering unfamiliar
clasp front gave twist pulling lid
tight fit eventually managed wrestle box open
inside objects wrapped greasy paper
nervously lifted unwrapping
heaviest package perfectly preserved metal pistol covered thick coating grease
second package covered jar oil dozen small metal cases inside
know went back examining gun
never used one gun ever seen used sub vizier
scrap dusty rag began wiping pistol clean examining parts went
accidentally released catch multi chamber cylinder swung
examined cleaned chambers oil realized metal cases jar fit perfectly
dawned hammer top gun strike end metal case firing bullet attached end
seen sub vizier fire gun somehow make ancient weapon work
removed one metal cases jar marveling compact machining ancients
snugged chamber closed cylinder
hands shaking pointed gun wall
closed eyes pulled trigger
click nothing else happened
opening eyes examined cylinder
case inserted lined hammer
time spun cylinder forward case lined
pulled trigger
ear splitting crack bullet plunged wall shattering plaster satisfying manner
weapon even odds anything possibly encounter
chapter spent entire week house waiting suvan heal
upon first examination found wound particularly nasty
boiled water carefully cleaned deep gash removing whatever dirt find
using needle thread sewed scraps flesh together
strong girl managed cry pain
spent time sofa resting house felt strange almost haunted
like spirits dead still walked halls rooms
always felt uneasy sleeping inside even dragged corpse bury deep forest
spent time exploring island hunting food bow went
fresh water stream availability rabbits birds soon gaining weight
finally walk suvan limped around house examining various artifacts
experience explained workings refrigerator oven ancients used power electricity make work
no one knew make electricity anymore seemed like wondrous invention little short sighted
want depend anything ethereal
man always depend burning wood light oil lamp
kitchen found container made wondrous material called plastic suitable carrying water
added belt carry
amazed pistol discovered claiming one ever seen
rare exclaimed hand gently brushed metal workings
said proudly seen one hands sub vizier
important men
worth fortune
laughed
afraid no one buy
anyway prefer keep
eleven shots left may save lives someday
shrugged
though scavenger know cities well still trust tools ancients
bow sword reliable
replied string bow snap
sword gets nicked dull use
like things tools must cared
gun no different vastly powerful
motioned dusty walls house
ancients everything technology dream
still dead gone
powerful things get poor owner home
face destruction old world decided kill
gun save life
replied wanting drop subject
seeing discomfort smiled
really matter pistol
trust anything understand
fully understand serve protect
spent last day preparing provisions filling containers water
really want leave oasis wasteland knew stay much longer
day seen several mutans coming stream fill water jugs
trails leading island also indicated best leave suvan accidentally discovered
sun slipped away left island returned trail followed canyon wall
block streets passed ruins becoming larger nearby streets crowded rubble
light half moon see buildings still managed stand upright skeleton framework showing broken windows collapsed floors
eerily quiet
world ancients dead ghosts past existed
obvious kalam rebel scouts gone area horseback using speed quickly traverse dangers
foot entirely different situation since mercy mutans strange beast inhabited wretched place
almost dawn stopped look place hole day
passing intersection two streets
habit looked gloomy road check observed
amazement thought saw someone standing front building one hundred yards away
though moonlight waning knew wasnt mutan figure stood taller twisted creatures
excitement pulled suvans sleeve pointed sight
asked impatiently
dont see
suvan began looking street
moment let gasp
took hand started cautiously street using destroyed cars cover
stopped ten yards away seemingly undetected
distance saw man dressed tattered clothes
notice continued stare ahead standing still statue
going take closer look whispered suvans ear
no wait
shouted broke grasp
foolishly ignoring warning stepped onto street quickly approached man
suvans footsteps behind
warning stop
within touching distance ground underneath feet began immediately break away
felt suvan grab arm late
dirt underneath crumbled
fell together hidden pit
second falling hit bottom hard knocking breath
time suvan landed next grunt
immediately engulfed cloud dust added confusion
alright
sheepishly asked suvan
dont think anything broken replied crossly found hand
dust settled sat clutching like children
soon found bottom rough pit approximately six feet diameter
opening fifteen feet away
immobile figure drew trap resting feet
wasnt man type statue made light plastic material
fool suvan said shock abated
trap set mutan
used old shop dummy bait fell
didnt seem catch fact quickly either grumbled
one walked right pit spat
warning werent listening
shrugged
lucky least didnt plant bottom stakes
found already mutan prefer cook food alive suvan sharply reminded
minutes sunrise better start working way mutan comes along discovers
try said little hope since task looked nearly impossible
first tried climb sides walls pit steep
also roughly cut purchase found quickly crumbled hands
fell back exasperation
next attempt merely braced shoulders wall suvan climb top
toes dug painfully top shoulders tried reach edge
far away
jump said gritted teeth
position shifted sending waves pain shoulders
jumped
shower dirt struck head took step backwards looked
hanging onto edge ground already giving away weight
soon fell able catch
collapsed together heap
hurt
asked rubbing jaw head connected fall
fine replied grumpily
dig way said eyed edge pit
take hours isnt enough time
spoke words punctuated lightening sky
dawn coming meant mutans soon prowling streets
dont much choice replied testily
idea dig one side pit causing wall collapse
stand mound eventually creating angled slope leading freedom
dangerous work since risked buried alive wall came quickly
started gingerly removing handfuls dirt time
suvan joined help
sun getting higher every moment
work slowly progressed noticed color earth darker
rich soil suitable farming completely unlike desert
happened cauase change
another mystery consider time
thought direction interrupted movement saw
human head long gray hair peeked edge eyes boring
hoo hoo
man laughed
never expected catch anything like
trap
called
course
replied giggle
else
thought mutans answered
hoo hoo
laughed
silly things never make anything clever wonderfully ingenious
fell
hoo hoo
funniest thing ever seen
looked suvan shook head eyes filled distrust
help
asked hopefully
well dont know
please suvan said
wont much longer mutans come patrolling streets
captured along
hoo
wouldnt dare touch
hold second
face disappeared edge
soon slim rope uncurled pit
made thin blue material slippery touch
motioned suvan take rope
started climbing bringing avalanche dirt
soon
followed suit difficult scramble found back street
suvan standing still bow arrow notched ready go
eyes followed direction gaze saw surrounded hundreds mutans
standing completely still sides blocking sides street
man rescued feet away
back stranger busily untying rope attached destroyed car
straightened began winding rope tidy coil
turned took steps towards
saw eyes mutans follow every move
youre safe sound man said eyes going suvan lustful manner found putting

suvan spat
eyes shining delight
wont hurt long
come follow
walked towards mutans parted let pass
without showing interest towards gray skinned monsters led trash filled stairway protected cracked concrete wall
followed gloom
chapter concrete steps led dark cavernous space rang echo feet
old man took torch propped wall lit
flickering flame revealed standing wide ledge made cracked tiles
number columns supported roof
tunnel far side passed room
without word brought small flight stairs led tunnel
beneath feet four ribbons unbroken rusted metal disappeared darkness
atmosphere dusty foul relieved see mutans followed
suvan finally spoke
name
words echoed tunnel fading whisper
name
dont really remember old man replied uncertainly
everyone name suvan stated
hollow laugh said usually called old one tahn suffice
tell tahn said
exactly
giggled
ancients called subway
used vehicles rode iron rails ferrying people city
tunnels snake streets stations giving access ground
ive found best way travel without hindrance
course tunnels dangerous good know way around
tried think something like cars driving underground hard time imagining anyone want
much better see sun travel gloomy passageway like
suvan practical asked taking
tahn replied grumpily questions questions either ever run questions
going home course
talk something eat dear
suvan persistent type
asked tell mutans leave alone
sighed
always left alone
left father alone father
family lived city since beginning time
mutans decided wise ways ancients
since descended power ancients wisdom sacrosanct
like holy man
asked skeptical outlandish idea
tahn shrugged
call
trap fell
capture mutans
hoo hoo
mutans
nothing discover replied cryptically
no looking new specimens add collection
always new creatures born wasteland especially city
study
no questions
glanced suvan shrugged shoulders resignation
continued walking
darkness tunnel time distance lost meaning
tahns torch light source flames casting long shadows dirty brick walls
passing several silent stations finally stopped metal door tucked side wall
gentle tug tahn door swung open ease reveal flight stairs
hope tired said
long climb front
promise good lunch though
long time since ive company
fine suvan replied
said
tahn giggled habit finding annoying
said well hope
started climbing
stairs perfectly preserved noticed sound boots made metal painted white many times
every dozen steps stairs stopped landing metal door
door number painted incremented went
time reached number twenty breathing becoming labored
saw suvan also tiring effort dismay tahn looking amused
seemed suffer no ill effects climb
perhaps used
hoo hoo
thought two youngsters able keep
dont worry suvan managed gasp
kept tongue said nothing instead concentrating task hand
stop climbing stairs reached door painted number thirty two
tahn extinguished torch dumping lit end bucket sand
opened door flooding stairwell sunlight
suvan entered blinking
eyes adjusted saw massive room ceiling supported row evenly spaced pillars
jumbles ancient artifacts piled everywhere along messy bed table modest nature
amazing part walls
nothing glass way around
building stood deep group skeletal ruins made metal fragments glass
streets laid regular pattern
east also see riverbed trickle water carried
view horizon spectacular walls canyon clearly visible
felt like see miles
suvan let breath
amazing
tahn cackled delight
glad think dear
waved hand direction buildings
compared ruins place free decay
lot hard work tell story lets food first
exactly eat
asked imagining rats even mutan flesh
let show replied proudly
tahn led back stairway
climbed upwards went one flight last landing
went doorway roof building
inside glass structure exceedingly humid
floor long wooden troughs healthy plants growing inside
immediately recognized tomatoes melons lettuce green beans myriad produce
never seen anything like
ever heard growing plants indoors
tahn talking proudly
greenhouse provides food need
water comes rain filled cistern tanks
works rather well though getting old bend working garden
lets return downstairs lunch
lunch turned vegetable stew
particularly tasty still better lizard meat
afterward brought three glasses red wine
good either beat water drinking past days
drank tahn started rambling length
wasteland survived long enough make heart city
seen dangerous murderous mutans evil creatures live kill
no place safety building mine
fresh food fresh water
mutans dare approach
true agreed wondering telling
continued need help
building requires constant repair maintenance stop father time taking rightfully
gardening alone takes hours time every day
need free time research figure makes technology ancients tick causes creatures mutate wasteland
looked
willing help
stay days help replied thankfully
glad another chance rest pushed mountains
guess suvan replied little conviction
chapter afternoon suvan sent begin working garden followed tahn another level building
instead great room like floor lived eyes greeted dimly lit hall
visible light torch hand faint light coming cracks around several doors
one many laboratories tahn commented reached nearest door handle
floor let say different interest
ushered inside nearly dropped torch disgust
far wall two dingy windows let light outside filter
center room shiny metallic table surrounded four unlit oil lamps
rested table horrid thing defied imagination motionless creature roughly size man structure bone purple skin made unique almost baroque structure
three long spindly legs fat almost bulbous torso five thick arms thought monster never possibly walk unaided
pale red face bore no resemblance anything human animal looking like distorted assembly unrelated parts
five eyes arranged haphazard fashion around two holes must served nostrils
two mouths one located cheek bared open reveal row razor like teeth
beauty
tahn said glee
swallowed pushing rising bile back throat
find horrible thing
laughed manner sent chill spine
surprised turns darker corners city
seen things give nightmares rest life
come help get ready dissect specimen
light lamps lay instruments
instruct proper methods surgery
lit oil lamps laid equipment suggested stood aside watched tahn went work
deft hand scalpel cutting flesh practiced ease
organs inside removed one closely examined
part done used saw remove top skull
brain tissue carefully removed examined placed inside labeled jar
speak actions sense detachment actually barely stand horror
insides felt like jelly
wanted look away tahn made sure pepper comments questions terrible work
finished carcass covered rough cloth
worked together lifting remains table placing cart
pushed room hall
tahn help wrestled body metal chute disappeared
asked distastefully exactly learn
much replied obviously picking apparent disgust
fairly common humanoid mutation perhaps even related mutans
worthless working
exactly working
asked afraid hear answer
smiled eyes gazing nothingness
improve flock course
mutans
asked incredulous
spoke like loving father
like children
like loving parent want make sure survive world
kill eat people protested
party horrible thing
stared expression unfathomable
reasons
like see mutans born
sure replied renewed sense sickness
come bad
words tahn led stairway took several flights reached floor twelve
opened door let pass first
stench inside unbearable reminding excrement rotted flesh
large area took entire floor
rows rows foot wide metal boxes floor small gray hands clambering get
sound little prisoners mix horrific wailing toddler gibberish
line windows provided light though wished sight mention forever invisible
middle room sat gigantic pod flesh twenty feet long horribly mottled gray spots
one end large orifice oozed yellowish liquid substance staining floor
side body mutan vacant black eyes small breasts spindly arms
stomach lurched finally realized seeing female species
tahn sounded like lovelorn teenager said beautiful
father father discovered lowest darkest part city
place even deeper subways
brought back experiment wondering thing exist
course smaller took readily steady diet meat vegetables
amazement given seed offspring
first mutan created
seed
asked dumbfounded
yes original father mutans
like father
felt strong urge run man sword stopped
suvan needed escape trapped right heart mutans without clear way
killing insane man hasten death
tahn suddenly said seen enough today
perhaps shown help brag accomplishments
let go eat dinner
arrived top floor light sun already starting fade
found suvan still busy garden intently removing weeds soil cistern watering plants
face streaked dirt clothes definitely seen better days
tahn watched bright shiny eyes
sickening
felt burst jealous anger course veins
abominable think disgusting old man even thinking manner
said perhaps two better clean eat suggested
use water cistern
go prepare dinner
suvan readily agreed idea took bucket get water
tahn left followed outside help
water ran bucket said low tones must escape tonight mutans sleeping
nodded movement barely visible
like way looking
trust believe saw
tell later
enough time right
get
shrugged
perhaps backtrack way came
washed two returned inside went floor
tahn cooking familiar smell simmering vegetables greeted nostrils
felt sick memory seen still strong stomach
food done tahn bade sit table
seated poured wine ladled stew
ate drank tahn kept quiet unexpected
instead talking kept glancing two expecting something happen
though tasted wine unfamiliar tang
stopped drinking pretended placing rim glass lips
nonetheless tiny amount consumed effect
head felt thick sleep
feel tired managed blurt
wanted tahn think close unconsciousness
ignoring words turned attention suvan barely eyes open
consumed wine
finally spoke lonely
father mother dead last one alive carry work ancestors started long time ago
gone someone need carry work keep place going
need someone give son
jaw dropped astonishment
words took moment register suvan
head jerked
mean
gasped weakly
else mean beautiful girl
murmured abruptly slumped onto table
tried stand protest found legs like lead
tahn smiled
two get sleep
need tomorrow since plenty work
chapter fell partially unconscious still feel someone rummaging jacket
moment sound paper unfolded
heard tahn laugh sound piercing layers drug
still felt strangely disconnected reality strength pry eyes open
saw moment filled revulsion
tahn standing sleeping suvan running hands greedily along narrow body
muttering
pretty one
anger inside brushed away lingering sleepiness felt
tahn even knew happening rose chair struck solidly side head
moaned crumpled slid side
suvan even react burst violence continued sleep
pulled roughly chair
began walking suvan around room vain attempt wake
toes dragged uselessly floor
couple circuits around room began tire placed back chair
shook shoulders yelled face
relief suvan finally peeled opened eyes
looked distastefully

come must leave
hurry
asked sleepily shutting eyes
immediately light snore gurgled past throat
shaking head decided let rest minutes
spend time packing food leave tahn awoke
looking floor fallen saw astonishment disappeared
quick search room revealed nothing
tahn managed leave without trace
hardly surprising since knew building better anyone
moved quickly filling canteens water backpack whatever food find
dining table found map rebel hideout note tai
wondered tahn found interest either one
shook suvan
time managed stay awake eyes blurry sleep
tahn
asked looking room
answered sure remember drugged wine
seems wanted stay permanently
slave wife
made face disgust
old man
never
dont think going give much choice matter
may old also knows much ancients
knows done
killed wouldnt around protect
suggest leave comes back
upon hearing suvan stood straight new blaze energy
theres no time waste
left taking door stairs
torch tahn used gone
instead propped door open started descend gloom
already dim natural light top floor gone two flights stairs
soon lost near darkness
luckily minor light still filtered doors landings
much enough slowly make way first floor
take tunnels
asked
light lost
fear number mutans surface
still day
long
shall find somewhere hide night comes
feel even safer leave accursed city
reached first floor without incident neither seeing hearing sign tahn
tried door relief opened easily enough
stench death hit square face almost causing retch
long corridor led left right
along walls steel doors set every ten feet
floor set gray tile thin film dust
dust wheel tracks looked made cart used
suvan covering nose hand
place
asked
know replied
ive already seen bet pleasant
trying handle nearest door swung open noiselessly
inside small room two levels shelves side wall
shelves white sheets covering objects differing sizes
directly across door also large unbroken window streaked dirt
metal bars covered outside
remaining daylight filtered dimly glass
rubble filled street seen
plucking courage entered room approached shelf
suvan remained doorway watching large eyes
gritted teeth grabbed corner sheet
quick yank cloth fell floor
revealed monstrous creature looked like childish version mutan
reminded little groping hands mutan birthing room
perhaps one strong enough live
misshapen eyes stared lifelessly
pulled another sheet free eyes greeted yet another mutan child
make sense tahn keep things
turning attention back suvan saw looking sick
said gently come let go
taking hand continued looking way madhouse
end hallway two doors hung together
small windows set eye level
panes yellow age still transparent
peered saw large room metallic table middle floor
top slab motionless human like creature
around two smaller tables knives rust stained saws jars filled dark liquids
scene right nightmare
however another door far side room
know lead find

suvan asked low voice full fear
want know replied clenched teeth
want let scared actually
let go way
turned double door side hall swung open
tahn
behind horde mutans blades held ready
wave hand creatures rushed hall towards fearsome cry
shoving suvan doors behind reached pocket took pistol
enough time take careful aim bound hit something way bunched together
flick trigger gun fired
satisfying bang lead mutan fell like rag
stop others continued frontal assault
pulled trigger three times shot easily finding target
mutans fell dead compatriots mass sprawling bodies
took chance duck behind doors
except corpse room empty
door side open
two strides
type supply room filled boxes hardware
suvan cowering corner eyes wide fear
quickly shut door behind looking way block entry since no lock
help
shouted suvan
rose stupor began piling boxes door
hold hissed
cant go shot back
whats
suvan suddenly said pointed grating wall
stacked boxes door began rock back forth
mutans trying push way
leaving suvan steady barricade boxes quickly went grate
large enough person crawl
saw screws corner rusted age
hard yank pulled ancient metal free wall breaking screws process
small tunnel sorts led darkness
get
shouted suvan
busy pushing boxes failing bulk massed mutans
door started reluctantly open revealing clawing gray hand
impatiently reached physically pushed towards open grate
suvan took hint disappeared tunnel
followed behind pulling grate
closed mutans broke open door rushed room
waited shadows pistol hand
foul beasts screamed rage found somehow disappeared
boxes equipment tossed aside vainly searched
took moment slowly crept backwards gloom narrow tunnel
chapter tunnel dark narrow dusty smelling many years past
made metal rippled sound went
cobwebs got entangled hair imagine state already abused clothing
ahead see dark form suvan edging blindly forward
relief sound mutans became distant every passing moment
passageway soon ended intersection divided left right passageway
way want go
suvan whispered
frightened voice echoed metallic walls
doesnt matter replied much confidence muster
take direction want long gets away infernal creatures
matter time tahn figures gone
surely mutans follow
afraid dark
chuckled
organized torches surely follow orders darkness
without word suvan took right tunnel followed
said holy man
mutans follow orders
suvan asked
shudder hesitantly replied actually holy man
father
stopped mid crawl making nearly run
mean
keep moving explain
many cities ancients
yes course said resumed moving
said never seen mutans anywhere else
place know live
makes place special
conviction replied curse ancients
evil spawned beasts decay ruins
spawn somewhere agreed
seen eyes mutans bred hands tahn ancestors
nearly shouted impossible
allah create take life away
saw female mutan alive replied quietly
breeds rather go detail
tahn hand raising propagating species
building army follow every command
preposterous said finality
let matter drop since pressing issues hand
darkness totally complete cautiously feel way forward
tunnel also descending alarming rate
since started ground floor meant headed somewhere towards basement
even worse new sounds reverberating walls
sounded like mutans inside tunnels tell far away
suvan stopped swore
go
choice
drop warned
voice rose frustration
far
risk
let breath
spun around took hands began lowering
held tightly listened feet kicked side smooth metallic walls
slowly inched forward allowing drop
time arms stretched way pit heart beating hard ears
think feel bottom suvan voice drifted
released hands
immediately heard light thud
relief quickly dispelled flicker light coming behind
turned head saw burning torch
line mutans coming inclined tunnel hesitant pace
ugly features lead mutan made even worse shadows cast flickering flame
pulling pistol pocket fired
bullet hit beast square face
pitched back slid towards torch flailing wildly air
stopped foot grabbed still lit torch
mutans put yell charged
waiting longer pushed backwards dropped
hit floor loud metallic clang
luckily suvan moved way crushed sudden flight
light liberated torch revealed small dirty room square openings walls mummified mice floor
suvan staring wild face streaked dust
hear mutans screaming panic since lost source light
matter time came
easier join returning along twisty corridors whence came
trapped suvan finally said
nonsense replied
way
see nothing behind openings fans
ancients must used tunnels move air building
whoever maintained building access room
exclaimed
without word began examining walls aid torch
suvan said egress blocked fan composed five blades grouped tightly together
no one fit past rust encrusted fans
investigation halted arrival mutan
fell ground painful sounding crack
chance rise unsheathed swiped sword
cut opened throat causing creature thrash gurgle terrible moan
black blood stained floor
suvan stared new horror moment started help go ancient prison
moment time discovered part metal wall fit differently others
flush edge door
gave push hand budge
near panic gave violent kick sent bolt pain entire leg
time thin metal buckled portion wall sprung open
small opening large enough someone pass
even said word suvan began struggling opening
legs kicked free gone
follow two mutans thudded metallic floor
spun around drew sword
foul creatures moved fast time rushed blades ready
slashed took feeble skills dodge parry blows
one blade sliced open shirt barely touching flesh
took lit torch shoved attacker face
turning away clutched eyes screamed dropping blade
one mutan left able use longer reach
quick work sword struck straight chest
let groan slid floor
took chance pushed opening
shutting trapdoor behind found suvan waiting outside accursed metal cage
expression one relief
handed torch
room jumble broken machinery covered layer dust
dim light torch see door sagging hinges
inside metal enclosure came noises
mutan panic escape
matter minutes discovered way
free soon warned suvan
sorry got scared
hate admit anyone like confined spaces
arent one said soothingly
enough talk get building tahn sends creatures
pushed aside door hinges gave way causing fall forward crash
going found short hallway flight stairs went upwards another steel door across way
place tahn used enter building subway
tunnels place wanted go right wasnt much choice
chapter fear lost suvan said minutes walking
fear mutans replied
tahn knows tunnels better
shall find way trapped
subway tunnel went straight hundred yards slowly curving right
occasional rat sound heard feet treading across ground
light torch flickered uncertainly wondered much longer last going
hellish trapped without able see
behind thought hear echo many feet
turned look shoulder saw lights behind bouncing strange shadows tunnel walls
mutans started search subway
grabbed suvans hand pulled along faster pace
hurry said fighting panic felt welling inside
began running headlong flight unconcerned lie ahead
no matter speed lights behind grew intensity since mutans move untiring pace
came split tunnel rail lines separated
without thinking took rightmost one
next hear suvans breath winded rasps
tiring wasnt much better
made yards suvan stopped
rest gasped
fear drugged wine still affecting
cant
theyre right behind
screamed
entreaties late
flash light behind
looked group torch holding mutans mouth new tunnel
saw amazement proceed
instead stopped eyes warily examining tunnel walls
take time consider caution instead dragged suvan along
relief mutans follow branch tunnel
paused wonder first thought flight
think gentle patter feet echoing walls front
first thought mutans trapped since remained dark ahead knew something different coming recesses underground maze
also rank unfamiliar smell
feet see piles white bones skull leered
sound footsteps grew louder
stopped pushed suvan side
crouched near tunnel wall notched arrow drew back bow
torch hand flickering dangerously low still enough light see approaching horror
instead multitude creatures single one
beast forever inhabit deepest nightmares terrible fears
outlandish mutation like centipede made human parts
legs instead multitude arms gray mottled hands
horrific appendages supported thick maggot like body twelve feet length
one time flesh may pink years underground living turned black dirt grime
head call miniscule compared bulk body
looked like head infant malicious row teeth red eyes certainly held no childish innocence
suvan let go bow arrow pierced body sinking deeply bloated flesh
creature let horrific scream sounded like child crying pain volume made head dizzy
blood came thick black
still beast kept coming appendages moving terrific rate
without thought fired pistol snap bullet echoing hallway
shot hit arm slow nightmare
pulled trigger nothing happened except click moment sounded terribly loud
haste escape forgotten reload
no time anymore
slipped gun pocket reached sword
draw blade creature top raising girth flail wall arms
moved amazing speed took surprise
hit terrific number blows sent reeling away staggering fought stay upright
twang suvans bow rang next ear
beast howled ear splitting scream arrow sunk deeply hideous body
aim head
shouted drew sword
thing came raising body rain series blows
time sword ready
swept blade towards flailing arms cutting ragged line flesh
great spasm shot body recoiled pain
still attack stop
time creature charged head engulfed tangle arms weight body pushing ground
sword arm pinned torch wrenched grip
rubbery mass choked air
couldnt breathe
world began spin away darkness
felt consciousness slip away
beast gave sudden violent shudder rolled
ribs ached pain felt rush air greet lungs
opened eyes saw suvan standing
looking concern eyes holding flickering torch hand
alright
asked
think gasped
help
assistance soon feet
entire body ached luckily nothing seemed broken
saw creature dead head pierced well placed arrow
wrestled ground gave chance aim explained
near thing gratefully agreed
let move mutans get brave enough follow
hope meet anything else like said disgust
horrible
moved walking carefully past monster
relief soon came upon station platform
moments climbing flight garbage strewn stairs night
buildings loomed
still heart city still joy free subways
reached top stairs suvan extinguished torch grabbed arm
let take look proceed whispered ear
peering edges stairwell suvan motioned join
saw street empty living thing crowded wrecked cars litter
appeared entire population city tried flee time destroyed monstrous weapon
suvan prompting began cautiously moving forward
due wrecked cars street take sidewalk strewn cracked plastic containers broken glass metallic wrappers broken bits buildings
buildings towered casting ungodly long shadows pointing away moon
deathly quiet except cool breeze gusted street kicking trash
find place hide rest suvan said breaking silence
know
stayed subway
mutans sure find
suvan visibly shuddered
no safer
go
rather die
walking another block came building must store one time
glass front long gone inside plastic mannequins tattered clothing stared lifelessly
doors torn open time ground inside littered decayed goods past
suvan said relief
rest scavenge place something useful
entered stepping cautiously scattered trash
elements done damage though place also looted ancients even mutans
progressed litter started give away collapsed shelves racks still held moth eaten rotted clothing
setup camp back recesses store
suvan fell fitful sleep heap tattered clothing took first watch
gently snored went provisions wondered long live scraps food two canteens water
long trip ahead werent going get valley supplies
putting thoughts aside reloaded pistol last remaining bullets
no extra ammunition use five shots left
based run far wasnt going enough get valley alive
glad still sword power suvans bow
chapter taking turns sleeping spent rest night next day hidden store
rising sun mutans outside busily marching streets
perhaps searching
slept suvan scoured littered remnants around found additional clothing wear
green jacket made plastic type material impervious water prove useful ever reached mountains
darkness came streets became deserted
left camp began traversing empty streets
skeletal buildings continued silent watch oppressive presence constant reminder days past
gigantic tomb home hundred horrors
also monument folly mankind civilization build majesty yet destroy easily
ever see destruction
thoughts broken whispering suvan
said horror subway think others
hesitated answering know
wonder things created
tahn hand monster
product ancient folly
replied
description taken mutations turned purpose
evil allah
punished folly
right concerns morality
must get back trail escape city
rations low survive far desert
food water low agreed
concern
still run mutans
know city
tahn bidding searching throughout day perhaps even night
never seen use torches shows adapting new circumstances
still afraid dark said confidently
obedience tahn allowed temporarily overcome fear
anyway find plenty places hide day
shall get end valley safety mountains
gave sigh despair
never come journey
lead death
tell thought lies end valley
mutans guard exit enough numbers stop breaking
impossible reach desert without running
probably story entrance
trapped inside like rats unless think clever way
shall find another way answered crossly
perhaps subway tunnels come somewhere else
going back said firmly
rather die blade mutan visit accursed tunnels
may wish spat back angrily
better ideas
immediately answer stopped listened make sure conversation drawn attention creature night
moment replied softly
know done better alternatives climb
stunned idea felt foolish coming
stopped talking momentarily scramble rusted car blocked sidewalk
back sidewalk finally replied walls cliffs steep
really think possible climb
try
first shall find rope possible food
hit desert isnt going much time hunting
also worried water
wasteland easy go canteen day
know get
shook head
ive never beyond river
either return depend luck
spent rest night walking lookout mutans
since depended torchlight traveling night no problem find way around
patrols see easy dodge
light morning came found remnants bank hole
floor covered blackened silver green copper coins strange faces unknown writing imprinted metal
vault door shut budge tried move ancient door
suppose matter useless things resided inside still curious
spent day inside taking turns keeping watch street outside
except sound passing mutans undisturbed
middle next night cleared heart city
buildings becoming fewer number growing even less frequent went
march suvan continued search certain type store find proper tools scale cliff side
nearing dawn found looking
large building front must glass one time
windows broken long ago shards covered sand
roof half collapsed allowing moonlight shine
goods inside scattered destroyed elements towards back store still intact shelves
suvan entered immediately began searching dusty items
finished pile goods feet
said ancients called sporting goods store
found good rope
daylight comes take closer look see else scavenge food
rope
anything old sure disintegrate weight
laughed
like ropes village made hemp twisted together made plastic like one use tahn rescued pit
material last many lives still strong enough hold many times weight
food drink
asked
water still problem ancients also way storing food make last long time
shook head
like rope
plastic food
no silly man shot back
people old ate food much like ways storing preserving food inside sealed containers
didnt understand
like canning
keep fruit fresh many years centuries
no one knows food last long time indeed
store carries special type used camping ancients apparently hobby
though sure anyone activity
lighter shall examine place
usual took turns sleeping early dawn light began slanting demolished roof
suvan went work kept watch prowling enemies
hidden position inside store watch street thankfully remained empty mutans
completed task suvan called show fruits labors
front feet small pile boxes metallic pouches
best ones find said

asked began poking hungrily rations
food though food requires addition water edible
shall still need find
remember important smell perhaps sample insides spoilage unless mind sick stomach
beef chicken soup rice lasagna even scrambled eggs
looked packaging found writing indecipherable
tell suvan actually read writing ancients
shrugged
know words
father taught knew
really comes job
visiting many cities start getting feel language
made decision
sat suvan told everything happened really going mountains
done pulled tai note tunic showed
may say something important
make anything
took paper hand
minute concentrated studying shook head
afraid far technical
words know simple ones dealt father work mostly regarding matters food goods
something beyond understanding
think really important
honestly know lost everything
told rebels mountains read language
one reasons forced go journey warned mujadeens plans
keep safe
thank showing mikel
nice know trust
chapter stayed store rest day hidden behind tall empty shelf
using precious water canteen first sampled food ancients
beef stew salty rather bland meal still satisfying hungry stomach
suvan ate chicken soup also sampled even saltier beef stew
strange consume something old innards rebel
full belly dozed next suvan coming night
suvan shook shoulder awoke
gathered supplies left store went night
carried lengths rope coiled right shoulder
suvan took food
changed directions time striking due north towards cliff walls
air still hidden menace night no sign mutans horrific creature
went past familiar ruins destroyed cars taking precaution losing footing rubble trash littered streets
sometime later reached without incidence cliff
point rose dizzying heights shadowed wall cold black
cover night see nary handhold crevice navigate
wall creatures seen dark lumps moving slowly without heat sun
hope climb night commented examined wall hands
let continue along wall replied
height drop get close exit
make climb easier
readily assented since misgivings idea
going difficult climbing rock lessening height help
began picking way westward heading towards exit accursed valley
no rest journey feet aching suvan finally stopped pointed
glow horizon ahead light nothing rising sun behind
morning still early
mutans said thinking suvans prediction come true
closed exit lit bonfires
way surely guarded escape
go no suvan said
close
looked wall
shorter still apparently smooth impassable
even climb section
looks no better
reply tinged exhaustion
let rest
long night
answer question go back go no shall climb
seen cliff side daylight ways thought looked difficult
best wait daylight comes find necessary footholds
spent rest night talking eating food ancients
splash water left water bottle knew suvan little remaining canteen
return river search another source within valley
escape take consequences wasteland beyond
dawn broke along eastern sky finally make irregularities rock face
good one hundred feet desert
though handholds outcroppings see ascent possible provided care taken
laid length rope tying together twenty feet distance
lengths rope used create safety points tie case one slip
suvan went first nimbly finding foothold handhold pull
went rope grew tauter followed trying use spots found
slow going
felt like fly wall
surprise looked saw already thirty feet ground
wind picking making feel vulnerable whistled past ears
sun already baking wall turning coldness night hot stone
wall creatures left grazing spots lichen like content cattle
rope creaked
looked saw suvan stop outcropping
took length rope tied around waist tying onto rock
lifeline case one fell
brushed terrible thought aside instead concentrated task hand
foot agonizing foot slowly pulled using rope sparse footholds
feet hurt throat parched thirst fought
half way heard faint cry
craning neck looked saw nothing
still felt growing apprehension
muscles strained pulled another foot using small handhold
cry became louder
looked time saw single mutan staring
quite distance away standing top pile rubble middle street
damned thing calling brothers minutes whole host fire arrows
sure infernal creatures find great sport killed manner
called suvan company
hurry
suvans lithe figure began moving rapidly rock face
surprised speed hard time keeping
several times rope went taut causing slow gain another foothold
paused tie another rope outcropping tying end waist removing previous one
took moment look saw mutans running direction
going close
sudden burst energy suvan finally pushed ledge
left alone rock face
clambered past last outcropping rested foot took much needed breath
mistake
arrow shot past within inches head bounced rock face
looked saw single mutan drawing bow
started climbing back clenched ready receive deadly iron tip
heard another cry sounded like creature pain
took chance look saw mutan lying back arrow protruding back
thirty yards away stood figure wearing black robe hood covered face
carrying bow
wave direction stranger ran disappear ruined buildings close
forgotten mysterious follower wonder fit
however respite temporary since dead mutan replaced several comrades still much alive
small knot creatures gathered together drawing back bows release hail arrows
saw glance hand found ledge
savage yank pulled
black arrows mutans flew head ended landing soft sand beyond
suvan helped
face flushed said must hurry leave valley hunt
bad fortune seen climbing
took run heading north desert
trackless wasteland felt strangely empty compared crowded ruined city
no shade heat relentless sun soon sweating profusely
stopped momentarily rest made suvan angry
no time
shouted
want mutans capture work
see man dressed black
asked breathing hard
talking
replied impatiently
must seen
saved life killing mutan infernal creature draw bead
shook head
didnt see anyone
isnt time talk right
take much effort mutans track desert sand
way escape distancing
shook canteen
nearly empty
last long water
better idea
snapped
turn shake head
no way stand fight overpowering force
option flee hope best
began running
sun grew higher baking yellow sand fiery haze
lithe figure suvan easily outpaced
whenever gain much distance stop let catch
angered since gave time rest constantly moving
words encouragement little help either made mood malicious
really wasnt aware danger facing labored crest high sand dune
forced stop top rest turned looked behind
shimmering edge horizon make mass figures moving towards
moving good pace easily faster
wouldnt much longer caught
shaking head wondered horrors city better place die
ran
lungs wracked pain legs felt like leaden stumps moved willed
throat parched tongue felt thick mouth dare drink last remnant water
dont know kept going perhaps fear cooked alive evil creatures
perhaps fear coming far defeated
even strongest wills halest bodies take much
much
no
dropped knees heat sand engulfing like wave
taking cap water bottle swallowed last stale remnant
tasted like best wine world
suvan stopped quickly ran join
flushed heat looked barely stand
must keep going gasped
cant replied uneven breathing
go without
wont leave replied testily
kill
stay fight
shook head
result death
no stay slow
anyways stopping going faster
reached pocket took note
take
head towards mountains deliver message
took paper hands stared stupidly slipped inside pocket
suvan leaned kissed sweaty forehead
without word left running hard
chapter one think one imminent death marching horizon
point really thinking anything
tired
still thirsty wanted nothing glass cold water
since available instead readied final end
gave prayer allah hoping recognize bravery
mostly watched mutan drew ever closer
least three dozen foul creatures
no chance numbers
mutans normally aggressive behavior seemed oddly muted since drew closer pace slowed
perhaps suspicious nature perhaps strange sight single man sitting sand no mind flee express terror
maybe suspected trap marching line bent middle flanks swept left right
soon encircled no means escape
circle silent mutans slowly drew closer together like noose
stood
forward motion stopped
one laughed causing others join
whatever evil thoughts passed twisted minds imagine no pity chance appeal
loud rasp mutans drew swords time dropping bows sand
started towards tight leer cruelty frozen terrible faces
remained motionless barely keeping fear check
experienced much suffering much pain truly scared anymore
going die going without whimper
without single word drew blade suddenly charged towards first mutan straight across
movement threw
time respond sword point drove deeply heart
wrench pulled sword free shoved past dying mutan
free circle still danger
temporary respite eventually surrounded
merely putting inevitable buying time suvan escape
without fear nearest mutan right rushed
parries swords went slash neck
soon two take place
longer reach helped hard time keeping slashes jabs bay
downed one blow neck slipped guard slashed leg
began bleeding heavily thigh
sight wound put mutans bloody fury
three joined battle
time no place turn escape
took step back kept blade swinging defensive pattern
whirl sword sang heat air crashing metallic clangs loud enough make blink
another mutan got close cheek ended getting sliced open
still managed lunge forward pierced free arm
pain white hot
blood bled freely wound making dizzy cold sickness
began lose track time
sun beat back relentless ferocity
throat parched feeling dry desert floor
aching sword arm barely keep persistent attacks
no chance rest
no chance live
mutans new sport enjoyed like trapped rat sharp teeth
sword black blood sharp blade nicked hundred blows
know many fell sword attack never faltered
legs soon buckled exhaustion
fell knees
remaining enemies gave horrific cheer
weak lift sword arm
weak anything watch death
one mutans particularly loathsome specimen twisted lips black eyes cautiously approached sword ready
nothing jabbed hard chest
steel bit flesh burst white hot pain
creature laughed screamed cracked voice
felt blood trickle chest spreading like blossom shock
mutan lifted sword high air ready deliver killing blow
closed eyes fell onto chest sand clogging nose mouth
heart pounded chest sounding like drumbeat ears
heard mutans give blood curdling howl still final blow never came
opened dirt encrusted eyes slowly turned aching head
mutans running
dawned horses
men horses charging mutans rushing pick discarded bows
speed horses won
flash spear points dozen mutans died spot
watch remnants mutans broke flee run one one
men horse dressed sand colored robes hoods covered head left face open
reminded mysterious follower dressed black
nonetheless men job grim determination letup final mutan killed
slaughter finally stopped rescuers lined raised spears
least twenty
gave ear piercing war cry another rider rode
man hood pushed back shoulders
hair iron gray face lined years living sun
riding saddle behind arms wrapped around waist suvan
released grip jumped soon side
weak move smiled weakly
praise prophet still alive
exclaimed
hand began run body examining wounds earnest
men
heard asking
voice sounded faint faraway
rebels replied began bound wounds
sun cut shadow man
rider borne suvan
stared blue eyes cold ice
vinc said
miracle killed many mutans single handed
day long remembered song never seen man slay eight creatures
tried nod motion much
faces faded away
slipped darkness
chapter awoke bath unnatural white light made blink annoyance
lying top bed mass pillows supported aching head
body felt stiff dull throbbing pain reminding still alive
strange light made flame power sun
turning head looked room
next small white table held clean bandages several needles length thread
walls painted white closed door
curtains single window drawn
knowing decided investigate
getting bed proved much
pulled covers back put bare foot cold floor tried stand without success
instead sort sprawled falling floor knees
found dressed nothing thin white robe
help
cried
door soon opened
strode prim looking woman undetermined years
like room dressed white frock pair paints
doctor fit

demanded know ugly face creased worry

answered barely hidden smile
hospital course
amazing alive
took several transfusions doctor interesting time stitching back together
transfusion
asked ignorance
laughed mirth practiced gravedigger

safely tucked away asked tell companion
traveling girl named suvan
said patiently worry spent hours side
poor thing tired keeping watch went got sleep room
nodded drowsily
suggest get sleep
time best healer still long way go better
final words turned left closing door went
falling back sleep easier expected
dreamed nothing
seemed like minutes passed suddenly felt shoulder gently shaken
opened eyes saw suvan sitting side
wearing new tunic pants little large build
smiled glad know still alive
happy see said face beaming excitement

croaked
long story mikel
left desert ran ahead fearing last ever see
soon ran horsemen explained situation rode rescue
afraid rather suspicious first told plight ready help
leader man vinc men charge right mutans
splendid see
saw wounded grieved
thought going lose
looked death door
admitted
afterward vinc men tie horse rider help
headed towards mountains dodging past mutan patrols
days journey remained unconscious
bad since missed seeing wonders
rebels live way astounds

bulb runs electricity
vinc busy showing everything
looked shining light found wonderful
bright artificial tastes
continued brought doctor stitched wounds healed
many days

note
shrugged
gave vinc
said deliver council behalf
strength shall meet
spent next two days bed
time ate plenty food slept hours away
suvan came visit spending much free time visiting local sights
jealous since window see pine trees granite slabs
seemed like long time doctor finally released hospital allowing tour rebel town company suvan
proved good guide explained everything
really small village protected natural formations rock stone
stream ran cold snow mountain peaks
water also ran dam generated electricity
scavenging city valley managed find necessary light bulbs material run wiring
amazing think something simple make power create light flick switch
stream also provided running water pumped various buildings four five dozen homes simple thatched huts insulated straw mud
grouped together along dirt paths sprawled random directions
hospital town hall built ancients
much like hotel made brick tarred roofs
town hall small library books even workshop men tried replicate work old days
fantastic enterprise considering limited manpower
gone town hall suvan stopped river watch water rush
grateful rest
sat together
wanted hold hand felt strangely shy even though shared terrible adventures together
think place
suvan asked interrupting thoughts
impressive expecting something replied
like
waved hands direction houses
must two three hundred residents
hardly army take mujadeen spread wide far
warlord said lead massive army easily crush something insignificant
suvan shook head disagreement
look technology
done far anywhere else seen
towns wasting away building anew
light water demand give men fight
right new voice interrupted
vinc
time dressed rough clothes laborer stern face no one mistake simple worker
well
time meet council
come
stood follow saw give suvan look longing gave twinge jealousy
keep eye two
chapter met council inside large meeting room located within town hall
walls festooned orange black signs cryptic arrows ancient words written
long table five men sat
center seat occupied thin man long black hair peppered gray
either side sat companions looked little interest
except member far left watched carefully though expecting worst
pudgy face white hair fat stomach bulged table
man sitting middle motioned forward
ibam elected leader council said
voice flat without emotion
closer examination man showed lined face caused much worry long nose cold gray eyes
gave little bow

bad kalam sent valley
last journeyed still mostly free accursed mutans
things changed since
believe tahn called father mutans trouble future
shrug shoulders

seems control know intentions
ibam said see
mutans used scrape existence ruins actively harassing traders even making raids nearby lands
even felt presence since traverse wasteland get food necessary keep alive
danger yet resources combat

suvan asked finally speaking first time
ibam smiled graciously
action note managed reach
thank
plan start slowly take countryside eventually getting populace side
army large enough battle mujadeen mutans
suvan replied coolly ive traveled many places father
dont recall seeing single place controlled
started members council murmur protest
man called lydon nodded
rate going never army large enough battle either
another smile found condescending ibam said mujadeen many
far lands across wasteland
agents place march time side
mujadeen grow weaker passing year
crumble
happens step make move
lydon jumped feet said discussed many times ibam
continue wait year year stop senseless battle mujadeen
continue live like rats cowering mountains waiting day may never come
make peace mujadeen trade even affect political process
sure warlord reasonable man
mutans real danger
deal first
fool ibam responded angrily
give away everything ancestors worked
barely survived struggling survive mountains
hard work intelligence today
want future children slavery tyrant even people
go interrupted speech asked please tell message tai says
ibam let breath staring hard lydon
moment hesitation finally said course mikel right messenger
tai sent investigate certain recent reports heard concerning mujadeen
rumored digging deep sand looking weapons ancients
far searches fruitless

mujadeen found old missile silo
according note silo intact unfired missile
felt confused words
mean
time vinc spoke words harsh
traveled wasteland
saw damage done ancients long ago
believe note tai mujadeen found weapon
no reason use
stared disbelief
surely weapon last years
seen eyes damage done time city remnants within
theres nothing rust dust
vinc said true ancients able protect important weapons harm
missiles buried deep ground went great lengths keep free elements
entirely possible weapon still launched
never dare lydon added without asked
ibam made known
said vinc said true need send someone investigate need put stop
stared said last words
surely dont mean
asked surprise
barely made alive want send wasteland
ibam replied seen
need someone familiar area around ewark
afraid kalam getting old activity
anyway want place community must help
blackmail suvan angrily interjected
call want afford leave
dont worry mikel shall vinc go along
bring dozen men
make sure protected
lydon strode room without saying word
chapter night returned hospital sleep
settling doctor stopped checked condition confirming good enough health travel
left shut lights went bed
instead sleeping pondered events day
though disagreed lydon council issues raised one point rising danger mutans must dealt mujadeen
also no mood return ewark even future depended
fair suffer much put life line
even thoughts nothing compared jealousy felt
possible suvan fall love pig headed vinc
tumultuous thoughts eventually gave away uneasy sleep
awoke
eyes greeted darkness found move
shout somebody held arms someone else affixed gag mouth
tried struggle using legs kick away blanket late since held many hands
nothing stop
body physically dragged hospital
dimness moonlight sky see four dressed dark colored robes hid faces view
thrown face waiting cart
cart pulled pushed along hand distance forcibly removed
small house windows dark lifeless
one abductors knocked door hurriedly opened
brought inside dark forced sit chair quickly tied
gag removed

spat
one moment disembodied voice answered
snap overhead electrical light turned
blinked several times
took moment recognize lydon
behind stood four men
dressed black robes reminded man followed city
asked impatiently brought
wherever
smiled benignly
whatever takes stop fool plan ibam
surely go without
countered
know important
know ibam like
spend much time fruitlessly searching thinking dont want live part bargain
give time friend return ewark
man standing closest lydon stepped forward
threw back hood reveal
surprise hussen man betrayed tai mujadeen

say
hussen laughed triumphantly
see mikel trick along
sub vizier decided let rescued fool brewer kalam
knew along
let come providing exact whereabouts rebel city
stopped desert patrol killing
saved mutan arrow
led luckily fall lydon men
told sub vizier willing make treaty interested say
rasid pleased return ewark tell good news
rebellion finally broken warlord sure award
looked lydon see reacted information
merely nodded already knew
said lydon truce mujadeen really think hussen help account
replied laugh
given certain guarantees
no harm come people provided give
better solution endless war waging countless years
finally peace instead concentrate mutan threat
better hussen agreed half hidden sneer
couldnt believe hearing
trust hussen
trust rasid
care anyone
lydon merely said agreement already made
talk
hussen said must going
sure pleasant time guest
bad never meet
shook hands lydon left front door
slowly shook head
said letting go doomed everyone
mujadeen come enslave everyone
maybe lydon replied
afterward made ruler town
no council ibam telling
eyes shone unnatural light found discomforting
man lusted power safety rebels
ranting part interrupted knock door
lydon froze face frozen shock
drew sword side
three
open
someone shouted outside
recognized voice vinc
sudden crack door burst open
rushed vinc several men
captors dropped weapons wanting fight best troops town
see man leave
asked hopefully
saw no one leave vinc replied shake head
gotten
suvan went check found missing
lydon obvious kidnapper visiting house finding empty came home brother
please hurt lydon pleaded strong voice reduced fear soaked tremor
council decide vinc replied without pity
chapter left next day using steep path went valley
horses kept fenced paddock
sorted packed stores mounted left safety rebel stronghold
rode back pack next suvan vinc soldiers rode ahead
hate say foul mood barely spoke suvan
took silence stride instead seemed rather taken new excursion
perhaps adventurous preferred quiet life
still smarting way treated council
lost way living taken great risks deliver tai message
recent troubles hussen lydon unfair given new task
also tired still recovering wounds received
still require go dangerous journey
wasteland looked glad horseback time
plan try catch hussen reach ewark
barring proceed silo try stop missile used
cover night hussen managed escape town unscathed
tracks discovered vincs men showing spy riding straight east across desert
follow quickly using extra water rations brought two pack horses
cat got tongue
suvan asked breaking spell thoughts
waved hand sand around
ready yet admitted
smiled kindly
no one ever truly ready life
best
watching awfully good job far
kind words brightened mood
thank say
wished said didnt know heart lay
squinted looking distant horizon
first met doubted good anything
proved wrong time time
fought suffered saved life several occasions
even willing sacrifice save
took bravery
feel brave
think anyone ever said staring
suppose matter whether run away
never ran
help blush
felt quaver voice asked tell interest vinc
laughed sound like silvery bells
whatever gave idea
know
perhaps way looks
tell interested
course grateful saving lives
also showed around town glad company
brilliant man way
see commented dryly
jealous
playfully asked
think right feel way retorted
mood suddenly changing suvan glared distaste
perhaps let go head
woman kept like horse favorite pet
decide life
shook head
say ever met woman like
met many women
different
learn perhaps talk
felt face flush anger
instead replying took drink canteen stared straight ahead
fell back silence hardly speaking word suvan anyone else stopped night
vinc never shown much interest trip stopped bedroll
men suvan sitting around smoldering fire decided go sleep
top nearest dune sat guard watch slept
join
vinc asked features shadowed darkness
shrugged
tonight prefer alone
see said even though tell tone voice
said look appreciate help crossing wasteland
never properly thanked saving life either
done twice
dead still need watching every moment life
no bother said dryly
sake suvan seems care
even make effort
stared
care thinks
life soldier lonely one
patrolled desert life fighting mutans keeping land safe mujadeen
never time women given much thought
saw suvan first time heart changed forever
worship strength tell
exactly telling
asked wondering soldier suffer shyness
sighed plaintively
two crossed wasteland together
also spent much time together fighting survival
like know stand
nothing said coldly wanting answer question
good said tone becoming brighter ever heard
free pursue
mind
go ahead replied hating glib
still angry suvan
wanted forget still felt flash hot jealousy vinc words
good
vinc exclaimed
clapped shoulder proudly stepped back join others adding bright laughter around campfire
cheerfulness made mood worse
slipped inside bedroll covered head
seemed like forever camp quieted
terrible thoughts jealousy anger filled head
took quite time finally fell asleep
chapter traveled
two days later came across wide furrow desert floor covered hussen tracks
traveled well past valley new sight strange
closer examination soft sand showed made hundreds marching mutan feet
move heading straight east towards ewark
vinc commanded turn side fearing catch mighty host
also meant stop pursuit hussen
day later reached edges ewark
time food supply low water left wasnt good either
part looking forward back ewark hated idea seeing burned remains hotel
thoughts tossed aside saw smoke horizon
heart sank stomach

heard saying
mutans vinc answered
tracks saw day headed towards town
war
shook head
mutans never attacked ewark
protected mujadeen
vinc replied mutans never moved numbers
take men horseback stop mighty army
sent three men gallop ahead
suvan looked visibly shaken group rode
remained silent fearful lay ahead
approached city see smoldering remnants buildings
nothing left standing even minarets mosque
found ironic rest ewark met fate hotel
cluttering streets countless remains bodies human mutan picked circling crows
sound heard flapping wings heat air
viewed destruction felt sick helplessness
somehow felt done something stop terrible bloodshed
sorry heard suvan say
riding next eyes wide fear
words exchanged since last conversation
nothing sorry said crossly
still angry embers words cooled since
hotel located
pointed crumbled walls
appeared fire destroyed inside entire building collapsed
nothing left pile blackened bricks
hard think everything owned reduced ashes
perhaps fitting tomb molli
wanted stay hotel end days beyond
visited ewark father suvan saying
seemed like nice place
okay replied
people deserve die way
no one deserves fate
vinc nearby listening conversation
said issue mutans graver ever expected
never knew numbers grown strong
never strength pull attack magnitude
said perhaps lydon right feud mujadeen must put rest mutans destroyed
surely pressing problem ancient vendetta
vinc shook head stubbornly
battle warlord mujadeen going generations
greater evil
surprised response considering great injustice given
pointed destruction surrounding
though tyrants mujadeen never killed great scale like
vinc answer one scouts returned
face frozen mask horror talked voice cracked raw motion
sir mile distant came across site recent battle
looks mujadeen met mutans fight
area strewn dead sides
mujadeen must put good fight many evil creatures left carrion birds
sadly also many dead men
signs show mujadeen forced retreat
say
afterward mutans moved ewark see laid waste town
thank vinc said man
go rejoin men
shall leave accursed place soon
soldier left suvan said shall
nothing left vinc answered
missile silo surely overrun mutans
threat mujadeen overtaken fresh events
return council tell new tidings
scouts return shall start back
seized idea said like see kalam still alive
waste time vinc replied
either dead fled mutans arrived
still want check replied sharply
go suvan offered
face alight idea helping
perhaps feel better something feel helplessness face horror surrounded
whatever want vinc said testily
least men return
quick
respond instead wheeled horse direction kalam
took gallop feeling angry vinc heartless words
seem care people town kalam saved certain death
suvan tagging along soon found ruins kalam house
tidy home charred ruin burned front door open roof collapsed mud walls scorched black
dismounted
rushing door pushed open
inside nothing blackened remains thing left sturdy furniture fine rugs littered floor
however floor made mud still intact
wondered cellar still undamaged
entering home treaded carefully wreckage reached kitchen
wall fallen covering trapdoor went basement
suvan
called
come help
soon side
worked together cleared away heavy rubble around trapdoor
carefully opened find glint arrowhead pointing face
kalam arrow drawn back bow
saw tension bow went slack
smiled relief
praise allah
exclaimed
thought returning mutans
laughed happy see familiar face
tell old friend survive terrible calamity
came cellar viewed destruction disappointed shake gray head
first let go outside get fresh air
familiar smell basement much
went outside
kalam looked destruction disapproving frown
stared suvan asked pretty friend
suvan
saved life wasteland
pleased make acquaintance said bow
let sit shall tell happened since unwanted exit
sat hot sand listened story
days left town began problems mutans
first nothing pinpricks little raids outer areas easily repulsed mujadeen
seems enemy merely testing defenses sharif recognize possibility
became worried survival
sent wasteland fully expecting minimal problems mutans
instead sent armed camp
truly apologize error
still alive commented blandly
praise allah safeguarding harm
main mutan attack materialized mujadeen no position stop
thanks patrols warned mighty host descending ewark
people town drafted join small mujadeen army
men stayed women children travel sent north
much time pray escaped without molested enemy
army mujadeen assembled plains south
assigned thin line bowmen left flank
middle sub vizier rasid held reserve hundred swordsmen command sharif
right cavalry two hundred horses
stood nothing worry wait
air quiet sound distant thunder rumbled west
first thought coming storm horizon turned black approaching mutan horde
years never seen horrific sight
mens knees quavered fear half army run sub vizier started praying loud guidance allah
words steadied men
afterward waited little courage muster
mutans marched towards without fear without haste
arrows rained turning sky black night
line bowmen fired flank like throwing rock swarm bees
everything looked lost cavalry charged straight enemy middle
know seems mutans fear horses almost broke brave charge
many foul creatures work
soon horses brought riders killed
ferocious pace mutans struck last line swordsmen soon overwhelmed
rest ran
fled safety basement hear screaming town destroyed
finally grew quiet found trapped
waited drinking beer arrived
nodded
glad survived
know happened sub vizier
still alive
know
horseback entirely possible escaped
asked eagerly missile silo
know
left took upon continue keep eye diggings
neither stamina agility tai still managed work close enough see facility
located two hills offering natural defense attackers
even increasing incursions mutans far know facility never evacuated
still chance mujadeen possession weapon
nodded
say
battle mutans wondered
thought perhaps sub vizier actually left bulk men guard missile silo
suvan angrily interjected said sacrifice ewark something like
kalam laughed imagine strange decisions powerful make protect interest
shall tell vinc said
return mountains yet weapon destroyed
chapter hearing fresh news vinc slowly shook head disbelief looking kalam
saying mujadeen still use missile
asked skeptically
know intentions kalam answered honestly
know may sacrificed town order save accursed weapon
send someone investigate return
perhaps mutans already overrun silo possess weapon
council want sure
vinc answered place heavily guarded say examine
asking impossible small force
cut ribbons tried enter
kalam shrugged
say
supposed soldier must figure something
volunteered
one man careful slip inside anyplace provided cautious enough
got close enough see silo kalam said agreement
sure someone else agility slip silo tried
vinc stared hard weighing possibility success
tell weapon
no expert weapons ancients
replied
no one truly say missile works
anyone assess possibility still operational
devices complex sign decay certainly stop missile successfully fired
mikel
vinc asked
shrugged shoulders
business destroyed town
weapon dangerous council says must stopped costs
obvious choice since nothing left lose
another moment reflection vinc answered
go
foolish venture best know returning
want go suvan suddenly said
watching conversation without saying word
surprised finally spoke glad wanted share danger
forbid
vinc said initial surprise statement worn
safe woman venture
eyes blazing anger suvan spat tell
go mikel nothing
dangerous vinc shot back bronzed face turning red
said gladly accept assistance suvan
words aggravated vinc words filled vitriol
go ahead get killed wash hands entire matter
stalked away back stiff anger
help notice satisfaction suvan looked retreating figure nothing pure loathing
turning attention kalam said best way get silo
took stick drew map sand
finished said see two hills
rocky difficult climb
silo resides
mujadeen built two tall walls hills enclosing silo within
also barracks made mud holds soldiers workers
rasid tent nearby use
silo look like
kalam laughed
nothing like corn silo
vantage point one hills looks like low circular hole made cement looks fresh day poured
large cover top protect missile inside elements
second man sized door base cement allows access within
suvan asked saw last many soldiers
dozen mutan invasion
many mujadeen trying find place refuge last battle
asked best way
shook head
walls guarded night day gate western side
foolish try way
saw everything described vantage point northern hill
perhaps find way side night quite dangerous
glimmer idea
turned attention suvan said scaled cliffs valley help ropes
think going
better trying find foothold night
rope suvan earnestly replied
basement kalam said eyes shining excitement
tie two together long enough
chapter making way camp waited setting sun
better work dark free mutan interference
finally arrival twilight left
vinc traveled rest men rode away safer destination closer wasteland
mood improved least time rode sullen silence instead speaking
using borrowed horse kalam led little group considerable skill picking best route travel without seen
moon nothing sliver cloaking movements darkness
closer progressed silo lighter horizon became
still night reminded escape valley mutans blocked exit keeping area lit massive fires
worst fear true
reaching crest hill saw countless bonfires grouped around two high hills
mutans laying siege remnants local mujadeen
motioned others stop dismount
pulling back horse got belly crawled forward
top hill stopped watch
soon joined others
must thousands cursed creatures said watched flickering flames
aye vinc said
never imagined force
must give foolish errand return council
suvan keeping distance vinc said sure reach one hills really tried
mutan interest seems centered around walls
think mikel
throwing life away vinc said
tone almost pleading
really deeply love suvan
blame
try said little conviction
really looking forward taking risk want vinc proven right either
missile powerful claimed necessary destroy used
hellish device already caused enough damage
ancients control impulses destruction hope
let get going suvan said impatiently
without word slid hill disappeared gloom
joining first pulled lengths rope horse
friendly handshake kalam glare vinc clambered slope hill
bottom found suvan waiting
vinc bore whispered ear
sorry
kissed lightly cheek walking away
even though face death felt happier ever felt
also felt like fool falling love woman
mischievous clever completely unpredictable anything
ran catch suvan took arm
soon holding hands making feel younger years
treading carefully heads held low came first line bonfires without enemy seeing
apparently mutans no watch patrols guard attack
since already destroyed local mujadeen army perhaps felt secure numbers
nothing left fear
vantage point see sleeping mutans dark bodies huddled together around blazing fires
still no time incautious take one mistake killed
pushing aside fear went
went tighter suvan clasp became
quake hand tell feeling frightened
chill desert night seemed even colder causing neck prickle unease
went every fire passed yet another bridge cross
reached halfway point number mutans increased dramatically
practically littering ground sleeping ever present muttering twitching suffering terrible nightmare
evil smell thick air making nostrils recoil disgust
point suvan grip like vice nails biting hard palm hand
moved cautiously ever stepping quietly gently sleeping mutans
every step torture knowing take one little mistake awaken wrath terrible creatures
circumstances time way moving glacial crawl
normal minute fleeting thing every second like molasses
seemed like hours finally reached last ring bonfires
mutans thickest
hardly anywhere step ground nearly solid black shadows thrown reposed bodies malicious beasts
suvan still found place step guiding dangerous maze breathing mutans
intent progress nearly missed movement left
suddenly stopped causing suvan almost lose grip hand
around blazing fire fifty yards away ring sleeping mutans bodies forming protective wall
inside wall evil flesh little white tent human pacing back forth deep thought
tahn
soon suvan saw looking let choked gasp
even though still surprised
made sense tahn oversee march army mutations see city still came shock senses
intuition correct tahn creator foul beasts like general leading humanity
worse crime anything mujadeen ever done

suddenly remembered message carrying read knocked foul drug
missile
suvans hand dropped mine
straddling mutan already notched arrow bow
dont
whispered urgently
get shot back
miss dont kill right away hell chance give alarm
wont chance warned hoping keep natural impulsiveness control
hushed words still werent quite enough
mutan feet rolled side back resting suvan calf
hesitation slowly slid arrow back quiver
letting sigh relief glanced tahn wishing somehow extinguish life
without mutans no direction force
no choice break apart return warrens city wasteland
kill also end life
shake head returned attention making way hill beyond
chapter kalam called hill really stony butte impossible climb given superficial examination
according kalam naturally formed impressions used clambering steep surface
left side hill found way
moments started climb high ground light dawn began breaking horizon
fires ringing mujadeen fort beginning die
see mutans beginning wake
reached top hill look mujadeen camp
line dozen soldiers armed bow swords stationed walls attention solely turned mutans
paddock contained horses low mud building took barracks single tent belong rasid
noticeable thing massive hole centered right middle camp
site excavation
nestled inside large concrete structure sunken round metallic covering least thirty feet diameter
site missile silo weapon ancients resided
coming far felt strangely elated
trouble experienced end finally sight
suvan watched glanced behind
mutans awake quickly lining stacked formations facing camp walls
shout went near tahns tent rest mutans joined frightful chorus
moment later arrows flying fast thick encircled camp
mujadeen soldiers nothing hide behind walls hail arrows fell inside
several horses hit sending running circles wild eyed panic
chance told suvan
guards inside busy pay attention
nodded jaw set determination
taking rope shoulder tied one end outcropping let side drop ground
moment climbing using feet brace side rock
moved quickly
arrows flew nothing close enough cause concern
made ground quickly followed suit
rope felt rough hands burning palms fingers rappelled
moments frantic motion feet planted desert floor
darted suvan hiding behind dirt piling leftover silo excavation
hiding spot watched
scene inside camp pure chaos
arrows flew several mujadeen soldiers running back forth no order discipline
front heard new sound metal striking metal
heard cry gates
gates
repeated several times response lackluster
suvan clutched hand breathing hard fast
perhaps stayed vinc said
shot baleful stare
rather die
leaned kissed mouth
whispered worry get somehow
made terrible city together another chance certain death
laugh kissed back
let go
said brightly
took running towards pit excavation
went past soldiers busy pay attention
engrossed dodging hail arrows dealing pounding front gate bother
jump inside excavation clambering towards metal door embedded side concrete embankment
suvan first reach turned handle door budge
soon added strength no avail
locked tight
another way
suvan asked casting worried glance shoulder
shook head
think go check
worry right back
made hasty reconnaissance around concrete structure find egress
returned suvan saw expression no way
get
asked voice rising panic rasid must locked said trying control fear
safest place right
mind suvan said shudder another barrage arrows went flying striking ground near
past feeling elation passed
going die trapped mutans broke wall
escape try gain height hill no longer cover darkness
mutans easily see progress hill trapped sides
ground underneath feet began tremble
shriek metal sliding metal rattled air
sound coming heads
quickly ran side pit look top concrete structure
immediately saw silo opening exposing wide black hole within
suvan
cried ran back
top silo opening
let push
grabbing waist hoisted top concrete
gained footing turned around took hand leaned back allowing gain foothold
soon staring dark recesses
dark gleam metal pointed upwards
missile cone shiny metal disappeared darkness
noticed metal ladder mounted side wall
pointing said suvan way
chapter took lead climbing ladder
clambered great shout heard outside
shout soon became wail panic
sound surmised gate broken allowing mutan host inside
thought made move faster since take minutes enemy brush aside remaining mujadeen soldiers
attention turned silo meaning trapped inside
light coming became less step gloom
missile nearly touching backs metallic obelisk past minutely vibrating unknown power
wished time investigate object leisure events moving quickly
relief finally touched bottom
waited suvan looked opening
pale light blue sky distant disk
smell dust dim surroundings looked free decay
really wondered relic really operational
surely complicated piece machinery last years without kind critical piece malfunctioning
know technology
suvan joined silo floor began searching walls way pit
darkness collection machinery piping attached walls made difficult
give hope row red lights ringed base floor lit
somewhere beyond walls high pitched bell started ring
glow new unexpected light enough suvan locate small closed hatch
twist lever open
inside bright unnatural light
without hint caution suvan immediately crawled
went glanced one time sky
little surprise saw face tahn several mutans looking
another moment slipped opening hoping find way escape trap alive
found knees well lit hallway
stand motion cut unexpected words rasid
well isnt old friend mikel
standing suvan arm around neck pistol pointed head
though may think otherwise glad see still alive
knows much longer
allow stand
staring hatred
also saw suvans eyes wide fear lips slightly parted speak
said impatiently mutans close behind
wont take long figure get
rasid laughed
time friend late stop
move
pushed suvan roughly forward made pretense meekly following
nothing gain death rushed even went pistol hidden shirt
rasid followed gun trained back
went hallway white tiled floor thick dust recently trampled many boots
end passage another metal door rasid motioned suvan open
waved gun motioning go
suvan went first followed
sight greeted inside beyond anything ever seen
around low long desk sat three men plastic chairs
one hussen stopped work give malicious grin
concentration lit panels front
unfathomable mess words symbols chaotic movement make little sense
rest room painted flat gray except far wall dominated larger lit panel showed map symbols
rasid saw confusion said thats something called display
told
computer electronic machine used targeting missile
ive told quite accurate power particular missile doesnt direct hit
suvans fear gave away curiosity
electricity asked come
rasid replied ive told theres small power plant buried underneath
technicians told enough energy run place another hundred years
simply amazing isnt
ancients truly masters craft
bad never got chance see particular missile used
sure pleased see still work years
replied suspiciously said something targeting
dark eyes shined excitement
astute mikel
always thought smart likes ewark
see given order warlord finally put end rebels
thanks hussen ive tracked location
power council mayfly completely ineffectual
still continue defy warlord glorious power
reason enough
use ancient weapon finally put matter rest
going destroy push button
looked rasid like madman
perhaps
mutans
surely threat rebels
look ewark destroying army process
free hand gave dismissive wave
ewark doesnt matter grand scheme things
rebels killed mutans easy enough destroy
warlord army see
youre fool
shouted
thousands mutans city
ive seen beat battle
overrun destroy every last city nothing left humanity
rasid stared blankly ignoring pleas
hussen stood desk
turned bowed sub vizier
said everything ready master
sure work
rasid asked
told technicians instructions quite clear sir
coordinates entered takes word fire missile
proper codes entered fire button ready push
never mind
fire rasid said voice cold ice
command hussen answered
talking slipped gun shirt
since rasid busy addressing man see movement late
stretched arm fired gun striking rasid point blank chest
eyes went wide shock blood began seeping wound
hand held gun went slack slid floor eyelids fluttering
let single groan silent still
suvan merely stared perhaps forgetting still carried pistol
hussen looked wide eyed expression one dismay
said angrily want get
take two leave
mutans
trapped pleaded
guess youll take chance like leave
well gulped
wave pistol two men left desk quickly exited together door
take rasids gun ordered suvan
quickly complied pulling pistol clasp
looked interest smiled
murderous brute want
let hussen go
choice
disarm weapon someone else figures use
rather hussen instead taking chance firing missile
anyway need save bullets mutans try make escape
destroy computer suvan suggested
good let get started
chance sudden scream
ducked head door saw hussen come running back direction
chased pack mutans
two men slow already lying floor dead
covered blood
hussen quickly cut slashes blade
behind foul creatures stood tahn
shut door wishing lock

suvan whispered looking screens front
tahn

going
felt heft pistol hand
chances going die
reached grabbed hand
let die together
took step towards kissed mouth
overhead light suddenly went replaced flashing red strobe
turned saw rasid hunkered desk hands control panels
turned gave one last leer slumped ground
running grabbed front tunic began shake


shouted
late answers since rasid finally dead
ground beneath feet began tremble
red light began swirl faster rate ringing bell started ring louder
meanwhile suvan rushed desk began randomly push buttons
moment door burst open
mutans rushed room swords held high air
chapter fired
first bullet struck lead mutan sending sprawling backwards
next bullet tore rushing mass tripped comrade
soon joined suvan began clumsily firing rasids pistol
barrage bullets slowed foul creatures nothing stop aggressive nature
kept coming glad chance strike human
kept firing pistol hammer fell empty cylinder
ammunition
throwing aside worthless pistol drew sword waited impatiently suvan finish shooting
knowing going die soon feel heart hammering inside chest
second later suvan threw gun draw bow
took chance started slashing mutans like man possessed
fire guns already made pile fresh corpses making floor slippery black blood
parried slashed jabbed blade suvan fired arrow arrow horde beasts
though actions valiant little stop tide
tremors ground gave away mighty roar practically shook feet
fought stand mutans
surprise turned started run away panic
unfamiliar sound motion firing missile somehow scared enough flee
within moments suddenly free attack
open door see tahn trying stop remaining mutans retreating
entreaties ignored soon living creature left hallway
overpowering sound missile launch ceased leaving nothing silence
looking littered remains slaves tahns eyes locked onto mine
scowled stepped sword ready

exclaimed eyes lit madness missile
came way get missile
mean old man
back city read note carrying
told great weapon hidden away
mine
came sons take mine
gone fool
shouted
creatures left said hefted sword hand
suggest late
ill never understand madness overtook tahn expression turned one pure rage lips curled hate eyes blazed passion
rushed fumbling object hanging waist
dagger brought high head
maddening scream tried plunge chest
tahn slow
dodged blow grabbed neck threw hard wall
head hit horrific crack tahn fell ground like rag doll
way neck bent knew dead

suvan whispered behind
yes
lets get replied sourly
went hallway opened door end
climbed metal stairs reached door already forced open
climbed pit silence ignoring dead bodies strewn within
camp devoid life things left broken arrows corpses
looked sky eyes following white cloudy trail missile
horizon red yellow glow brighter sun
