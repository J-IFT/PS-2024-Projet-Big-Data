prologue oldest fields space beyond farthest galaxies edge cosmos shines solitary light
moving forward glorious vaulted arc inevitable journey
object sears emptiness fire ice comet racing across heavens
millions millions years pass unheeded trailing time traveller flies becomes speck light ancient eye
light grows night seen first ancestor earth still young
streaks screaming skies flies void seeming forever travelling one day return
millennia pass
circuit comet lead destruction flare grows night sky
time around pass crashes devastating destruction onto surface planet call home
lodges small piece foreign matter beneath skin earth slowly cools
time forgotten
ages pass continents take shape shift ever moving new forms
inside crust living place comet lost outer shell reveal within single massive crystal
buried beneath hill island
crystal grows begets another another material comet consumed
within secret place yet unfound crystals wait clear pure substance earth
formed materials beyond comprehension essence time distilled destiny part future
chapter one big city lights late night outside black
small wooden box lies open hold two clear gemstones hand
firelight plays across facets crystals
remember
book lies open desk turn read words written
desk light reflects black glass window
town dark silently asleep
open window hear sea breaks shore
everything island close sea
smell salt seaweed permeates fabric lives
wash waves fiery crackle pebbles rasping beach play constant background rhythm every thought
sea clouds part moment
sudden glance moonlight wave tops momentary flowing canvas deep marine blue caresses eyes like mirage
sensations always near
clouds close yet deep night still sense movement sea far
mind wanders beyond confines night island home suidhe
sea controls lives everyone
live die water weather
ever changing exudes emotion temper free like living thing
seen gentlest waters kiss rocks murmuring ebb flow
felt earth jarring beneath shuddering crash stormy mountain waves shout rocks anger
either side town low earthy cliffs rise pebbly beaches
glistening peaty streams tumble waterfalls shore waves
late summer seals bask play rocks emerge water like broken teeth beyond cliffs
endless turmoil gulls patrols sky
eastern coast sheltered extremes weather softer gentler exposed western shore
rocky coves inlets hidden folds hills reach green fingers island touch waters edge
streams rise springs hills centre island fall dancing small ravines
gather river flows across plateau sea cliffs
waters surge final valley pass stony estuary shelters steep wooded hills old bridge
small town home lies lowest part coast
face bravely across water towards mainland big city glistening ribbon light horizon
mainland town modest village small island centre living proudly considered town
oldford quiet slow settled place winding streets climb harbour
old houses rise stony ground either side steep lanes
stand one seems one perches roof house
stone walls hewn old quarries hills even roofs tiled slabs stone
old houses emerge hills seamless continuity grey hard
yet stone softened ages weathered walls covered lichens moss pillows roofs
western side island storms blow wild windy vastness empty ocean batter ragged shore
gulls gannets noisily cruise air stony heights ceaseless waves
cool dark caves pierce steeper cliffs issuing streams ferny shadows
trees grow salty wind stunts growth living things
one sheltered inlet hides behind spur rock curves around small bay foaming sea pounds turbulently entrance natural harbour
carves rocks cliffs gullies rise fall stormy tides
small fishing village newbridge shelters gap ragged cliffs
grey brown rock walls protect worst winter gales
buildings cluster around inner harbour
tiny bleak shed like cottages solid low
small shuttered windows heavily braced doors
wildest winter penetrate solid white walls
inside parlour cosy place rosy cheer peat firelight flickers faces friendly warmth
whitewashed walls turf covered roofs home no hundred inhabitants four families
dozen small fishing boats rest keels mud awaiting tide rise
stalwart fishermen uncles cousins sons fathers sail sea
meantime boats womenfolk keep house garden praying good weather good catch safe return
life suidhe always weather
midnight storms give way silent calm dawns
bluster winds free days monotony drumming rain
strange enclosing fog binds everything cold close wet white
clouds fade quickly sun rise perfect blue mornings bathed happiness refreshing early light
oldford newbridge settlements island
single road rises valleys cliffs winds way
follows coastline around past south point stony haven
centre island hilly roads traverse
goat tracks old drovers ways twist climb way tight valleys reach broken moors surround rocky heart tracks narrow ways
south east valleys spread small fields cultivated centuries fishermens wives tilled land men folk sea
north west remain untamed wild great herds deer roam freely valleys call deer gardens
spent childhood island
many children fewer today
free time filled lives ancient pastimes uncorrupted modern world
helped home
helped crops animals
helped boats weather fine
playing exploring adventuring together alone came know understand island home
spent evenings fire families alone reading rooms
distant sound voices raised song issued houses tavern break silence dark winter evenings
thought old ways never end others less comfortable saw idyll harsher reality
adrift ocean twinkling lights horizon stayed ever present minds
stood curving coaxing thoughts temptation cross sea
life island changing
still insular completely isolated mainland
early every morning ferry came dock harbour bringing provisions visitors
returned mainland taking men island big city worked
evening ferry repeated trip
ferry became lifeline regular tides
without no longer survive
late hear parlour clock striking two calling sleep
work little longer
tell
name harold small harry everyone knows
live old cottage near steep top steep hill oldford overlooks harbour sea
sometimes autumn days see smoke rising lazily squat chimneys drifts hangs pall valley obscures cottages
sit room look dark window see across mainland big city
lights city shine twinkle horizon like distant fairground floating sea black
look lights remember back lad thirty years ago things

late summer holidays sixteenth year went old harbour oldford

night dream life big city glittering lights glittering dreams dreams no hold reality
island ancient remote years ago roads stony paths

instead sitting quayside watching others go

best friends father went month always came back

teacher island school inclined jovial serious
got along fine something big city didnt like made seem fascinating
often sat harbour making plans escape adventure
hill behind house curved steeply jagged cliff passed within feet walls
no one watching possible jump rear window onto ledge rock jutted back garden
sometimes creep secretly leave window open return
father horrified angry known foolish leap across
never entered thoughts might dangerous
slip silently harbour one evening dark climb aboard ferry sailed able hide away board
arrived mainland explore big city night
ferry returned island morning run hill climb house time go downstairs breakfast
no one ever know away secret
plan never work course
problems seemed insurmountable
avoid seen
board ferry without buying ticket
certainly afford fare
never gave thought happen caught
racked brains weeks without success find way crossing sea rejected idea outset
island isolation seemed complete one day something happened gave illogical hope plan
close centre island hill called sgurr cavan raises rocky summit higher others
view sea around compass top
islanders call temple wind
good name always windy
heard old island legend place no one seemed know
knew something going mainland
time passed found nothing

sat beside old eric one day
nut brown old face held twinkling clear eyes half hidden beneath thick bushy eyebrows
years sharp sea air roughened skin made swarthy

hard penetrating gaze old man scared spoke
turned away looked across water story began
long time ago say lived extraordinary man came suidhe
traveller magician doin magic pay
magician great tall man white flowing hair strange ways
large black cape hed wear cover
imposing figure
stood crowd might say
bright eyes set old mans face
never walked slowly
wherever went took mighty strides like man purpose mind
folk thought entertainer played games magic
others took seriously
name although real name couldnt say
called mythras ancient myth
old eric took pipe started methodically stuff bowl tobacco continued tale
stayed entertained high folk elders
cast spells keep away vermin
tis said mythras magic water make people laugh cry
talked stars planets earth
one thing folk wanted see kept hidden except special chose
small wooden box inlaid mother pearl carved fancy patterns magical signs
say made box wood special tree distant land
inside box kept massive gem stone
pale glassy crystal magic change colour
seemed glow looked
looked drawn like looking lovers eyes
stories tell looked magic stone never forget
glowed formed pictures mind like embers fire
crystal pictures filled dreams patterns light stretched back night
minister chapel time strict like
took dislike magician called charlatan bad man
made folk believe magician evil fraud
magic aint possible said
folk superstitious believin days magician made welcome longer
long packed bag leave
mythras went harbour right hire passage mainland big city
none locals take scared
people got together chased edge town told magic away wait boat mainland folk take
told come back town
magician stopped turned turn stopped faced
looked magnificent flowing beard glowing eyes
children hid behind mothers skirts
men wavered felt power
magic none strong man piercing eyes blazed
spoke grand voice saying curse
refused passage treat like criminal yet done no harm
helped many times knew repay
call fraud cast spell see truth
none ever leave island live
present smallest child held captive place
try get away succeed die trying
leave see remember
yes
remember
saying turned walked hill leaving islanders gaping silent
nobody moved spellbound
mythras made way centre island climbed sgurr cavan summit
stood place silhouetted lurid sky raised hands cast spell whole island suidhe
almost great storm began rise horizon dark clouds filled sky around
got dark like eclipse
strange spinning wind came racing across seas towards island
islanders hear screeching like hundreds wailing souls
storm began many ran shelter fearing work devil
sky black night lightning forked like snakes tongues close folk hear hiss crackle
billowing clouds formed tension filled air
men ran harbour secure boats
rain began
great heavy sheets water swept across harbour lashed strange dark vortex came closer
cry went tornado take cover
run run run lives
voice lost screaming wind
whirling fountain air seemed alive sucked jets seawater consumed anything fell swirling cauldron base
fearing safety men abandoned boats struggled chapel
time stone building town
chapel bell swinging wildly steeple pealing disaster
inside folk gathered wondering praying
children screamed window glass blew tiles ripped roof
noise awful place seemed filled fearful madness
outside tornado rushed across island like mad wild thing terrifying animals pulling anything path
say went right summit sgurr cavan plucked magician stood placid arms raised waiting
chapel people found minister cowering corner whimpering pathetically
attempts talk failed
said day storm hear man whimpering chapel tis likely wind flue
storm died quickly come
folk tell winds like sound ghosts laughing sped horizon
island everything soaked heavy rain
torrents gouged ruts roads swept away bridge
everywhere trees leaning fallen across paths
broken boughs crashed onto roofs
animals fields broken fences ran wildly panic stricken place place
worst boats harbour lay smashed submerged gaping
splintered wood strewn across decks
single craft left endure dangerous journey mainland
seemed magician exacted terrible revenge islanders
yet incredibly except ordeal experience downfallen minister one islanders come real harm storm
elders satisfied everyone well sent team young men salvage harbour
without boats fishing knew soon starve
others dispatched attend old young houses clear town best
knew long task
many weeks passed normality return many years pass curse finally forgotten
next day five men set climb top sgurr cavan find magician
hoped found armed case trouble
got closer sgurr cavan devastation increased
stunted trees bushes ripped away lower slopes
close summit hill vast amphitheatre shaped corrie
fearsome place storm winds gather rocks tumble
whirlwind dumped load debris across island
rocks boulders roof tiles uprooted bushes even wood boats harbour deposited like much jetsam beach yet top hill
centre bizarre strange old place found pillar glimmering rock crystal high man
none ever seen none knew come
said came ocean
others said magician turned stone
everything changed forever
good word mythras gone without trace
never seen islanders
long time passed five men told no one else seen hill
townsfolk busy repairing rebuilding bothered
magician gone mattered
weeks following storm nobody left island
memory magician said still fresh folk keen try tempt fate
need go mainland supplies urgent
days no ferry islanders fetch provisions
usually sent pair boats fortnight take produce market bring back essentials
time come go market two boats salvaged repaired
boat volunteer crew two men four men top hill storm
early morning perfect day journey
weather fine sea calm set sail mainland
many island folk watched little boats move across waters
felt happy life last returning normal also felt little uneasy
curse mythras
boats ever return minister right magician
storms unusual island although no one living ever seen tornado
sailors expected return evening late day people began gather harbour wall await boats
first star shone clear evening light daylight faded two sails approached harbour walls
exclamations relief small crowd gathered wall
evening breeze blew heavily laden boats briskly homewards
light enough see boats neared quay
last moment anyone realise something wrong
boats came low water weighed cargo
sailors surprised
hadnt sails dropped
leaving bit late whats
boats rode straight harbour wall
men scrambled help unload boxes crates discover crews gone
boats full provisions four men disappeared
no sign no clue signify vanished boats returned without crews
nothing unload supplies
days later mainland boat arrived enquiries sent back big city came nought
mystery never solved men never found
time mainland crews brought provisions beginning ferry
time passed healed wounds wrought great storm
islanders slowly forgot ordeal mythras magician
however two strange events took place time
first known top sgurr cavan seen pillar crystal
exactly one year storm strange pillar vanished
no one knew
time one dark night two boats sailed home mysteriously empty also disappeared
no one recalls magicians curse came true
generations passed many years folk witnessed great storm grown old died new minister came island
name reverend finder became interested history place
heard old tales mythras storm told yer became intrigued started investigate mystery
research called island folk didnt take
investigation didnt last long went missing whilst walking one day tis said found crystal white crystal mythras
search made wasnt found
later body man found bottom ravine western coast
appeared fallen quite dead
reverend finder anyone island
folk thought little

story harry boy
turned away ran street
chapter two chrissy girl looked letter
red headed teenager tall lively grey eyes
always move even sitting fidgeting twisting constantly picking putting
wore old dirty shabby clothes patched faded jeans threadbare shirt
room sitting also haphazard
old farm kitchen hardly changed hundred years
furniture made heavy unpolished wood rough time worn appearance
plates dishes ornaments sundries covered sideboard table
freeway bess two labrador dogs lay large wicker basket front old cast iron range
dozed heads lolling black golden forepaws
despite wavering midsummer heat blowing open window mica windows door range glowed red woody embers flickered lazily casting shadows across stone flagged floor
fire burned every day no matter weather long anyone remember
old nails hooks studded blackened beams ceiling
cooking pans tools implements string onions bags herbs tankards leather belts old horseshoes thousand items accumulated many lifetimes used forgotten awaiting time occupied hooks
kitchen centre farm life meeting place office dining hall surgery occasional boarding house
old place full rafters memories histories
lives generations farm families played theatre room comedies tragedies music hall farce
echoes memories reverberated ancient walls
late morning tall thickset man wild auburn hair pallid skin walked open stable doorway
farmer father red headed girl
seemed weary angry pulled worn boots left sagging lay
shirt sleeves rolled back elbows revealed powerful arms large hands long stained fingers
wiped sweat brow large red handkerchief
chrissy rough voice boomed get tea love
sat heavily leaned across table
girl went range hot kettle stood black steaming
refilled pot let steep
room silent minute brought mug tea across room placed grey boards beside

father looked gripped mug fiercely
eyes alight anger
okay shouted
no right dont know going
never worked harder killing cant

mother talked
want go aunts house big city
shell look settle ill find place family
father looked straight daughter spoke mind full dam dam held back future life left empty dry
understand happened
never believed possible day river began run dry seen eyes
huge new reservoir hillside full water filled great steel pipeline snaked across plain big city
stolen water livelihood left starve loving wife beautiful daughter
water company offered move different place
offered buy farm
warned weather dry might run short never admitted truth
proud indignant hurting family suffering
dug well already dry
wanted sink borehole couldnt afford without neighbours help taken water companys money gone
turned bowed head looked dusty window
fields stretched wide across plains towards snowy mountains
farmhouse stood centre farm
ragged old track scratched across surface fields dustily tracing way towards road
farm lay farthest edge vast prairie called heartland stretched across arid miles featureless flat lands mountains sea
crows stalked fields among remains crops
dirty grey trees stood skeletal leafless plain
dusty mounds dykes showed ditches ran water
pond farmyard almost empty
inches slimy green water buzzed mosquitoes
one sad duck stood bank looking quizzically scraggy weeds
world intense fire like heat
sun seemed fill sky blazed
creatures walked bowed heads lethal light
blistered grey trunks elegant trees lined edge distant field traced path dried river bed sorry place
look outside chrissy take look
cant fill river
got go
cant wait till rains come year
wont last long
might rain weeks itll take rain river flows
know whats happened
man goes meddling nature always ends disaster
theyve undone balance thats theyve done
chrissy see anger eyes wanted stay
farm dad
cant leave
cant sell love worth bean
madman come
farmer waved hands vaguely behind
looked sullen
sound movement pierced walls door parlour opened
woman sailed dressed flowing blue
long black hair tidy bun
wore dark blue sash around slim waist delicate gold brooch shape fish dress
walked across room humming seemingly oblivious girl man already present
sad man looked wife
beautiful woman love great
crisis lives proving much
shut truth
lived make believe world pretending life go normal
conceive time leave parents farm
lived life parents grandparents lived
generations reached back first settlers one family one farm
stood went proud serene woman standing old spotless sink incongruously singing sad song soft melody
love dear said quietly
listen
chrissy must go soon
take coach little
must say good bye
wife looked
turned daughter
well gushed must get ready
dress journey
hope lovely holiday darling time come back everything fixed
chrissy looked mother saw tears eyes
even mother strength face truth
knew no return farm
mother daughter went silently upstairs
came later carrying old case
transformation taken place chrissy looked essence country society girl
older younger self possessed vulnerable
hair arranged tidily wore best clothes possessed
standing side side mother daughter presented picture pathos beauty
chrissy carried bag containing valued notebook old book poems small wooden box carved lid favourite old togs
dress wore mothers treasured brooch
outside father old car ready
seldom used rusty black relic
always gone area horseback
horses sold
cars old engine running minutes smelt hot oil idled yard
tyres cracked leather seats creaked car still worked enough one last journey highway
packed bag boot opened door daughter
chrissy started towards car hesitated looked back house silhouette mother standing open door
suddenly turned ran
chrissy
shouted father
kept running came bank old river lay desolate murky
stood looked place remembered childhood dreamy sun soaked days swum splashed cool water
years walked banks river waded clean clear waters
dozen winters seen icy beauty place
remember whispered
remember secret river good bye
looked minute longer tears welling behind eyes returning car climbing seat without word
father shut door set lane
chrissy looked back waved disbelieving mother
old jalopy bumped track billowing cloud dust slowly weaved around potholes towards dirt road
half hour later freeway chrissys father waited see daughter onto bus take big city
old grey coach came view pressed envelope hand gave kiss
thats
aunt look
take care journey sure write
remember love
good bye
minute later turned away bus faded heat haze
eyes glistening climbed back old tattered car turned around towards farm road
beneath noise car felt silence pressing
turned radio company words gave no relief
journey big city long trip chrissy felt uncomfortable fancy clothes
longed arrive turn back true self somehow knew never return old ways
aunt visited farm two three occasions chrissy young
hardly knew
want live aunt even short time
chrissy never city smart girl knew ways world country life suggested
lifes harsh realities exposed farm births deaths good times bad
even though crude sometimes brutal truthful
seen much life country dam spoilt
friends gone one one
village two miles farm slowly emptied nearly deserted
school closed
knew stay always hoped
people rare treasured heartland
possible pass someone without stopping speak
distance folk drew together
farmers shared precious possessions time
everybody helped everybody end disparate community split asunder moved apart
left alone read books whenever escaped worlds

going
sitting uncomfortable grubby seat felt life moving reality new fiction
bus trundled noisily stop stop seats filled passengers
chrissy shy
used talk everyone saw
country farm miles anywhere never felt lonely scared
travelling towards big city moving different world different order
people bus kept
felt like outsider looking
saw one pretending others visible
remained alone aloof little worlds
loneliness eyes saw hints desperation
chrissy thought friends first time life suddenly felt alone scared
bus ground chrissy sighed turned head looked dusty windows
countryside gave way scraggy hamlets hamlets turned towns
telegraph poles lined verges filled sky wires
road slowly filled traffic cars lorries bikes buses roaring rushing
wooden houses small neat towns led brick houses blocks flats
pavements side roads streetlights shops
paraphernalia urban life crowded edge road
people everywhere crossing road getting bus shouting pavements looking shops waiting cars smiling laughing crying everywhere
chrissy filled eyes sights head ached
smell exhaust stuck throat made feel ill time seemed accelerated
much going yet oddly seemed little happening except bluff fluster
felt looking dream
brick houses gave way concrete offices apartments
intersections railways enormous buildings flowed past growling bus wound way centre metropolis
finally stopped amidst fleet identical buses lined oily grey tarmac terminus
people jostled get hurried away
chrissy sat stunned silent unsure next
driver turned
hey end road girl shouted bus
aint got home go
jerked head eyes red damp
looked thought might crying
time smiled

okay
let help love
going
asked kindly
chrissy showed aunts address driver directed another bus
show driver hell tell get reassured
towards end afternoon chrissy arrived aunts apartment block
felt tired shocked total change surrounded
uncomfortable embarrassed pretty old fashioned country clothes
noise pain filled head throat dry sore
wanted anything go sleep forget
aunt slack looking woman slouching lamp post waiting bus lumbered halt
chrissy knew even greeted never never friends
jessica said aunt jessica
call jessie
going grand time
aunt jessica spoke smoky drawl incessantly punctuated drawing breath cigarette
wore scanty casual city clothes intended someone half age
aunt jessica talked unceasingly anything came head
conversation monologue meaningless
ways city important
fashion purpose life
looked pretty niece critically way made chrissy hold coat tighter protection
youre cute outfit
believe youre honey dear purred gritty voice didnt smile
aunt jessie still leaned post casually smoking cigarette
jerked head walked across throwing cigarette stub pavement
jealousy chrissys natural young beauty lay smouldering
aunt jessicas flat gaudy clothes
small rooms appeared smaller overpowered bright colours oversize patterns
ornaments furnishings filled every wall corner
clear space room reflection seemed scare
whole resembled charity shop showroom like shop never quite clean
no books seen
aunt jessica never found time read
two weeks later sun setting across city skyline
usual chrissy alone apartment high grimy litter strewn streets
knew aunt back early hours come back probably bring another friend visit
chrissy welcome
went room get ready bed changed mind went instead collect handbag go street
walk good thought longed stretch legs across miles used country
street dusty heat summer evening filled air stifling slow
people wandered scuffing feet hard pavement lazy walk
sound music mixed distant cacophony traffic freeway thousand half heard conversations drifted open windows
chrissy decided find bay knew somewhere ahead
although evening night never truly found way onto streets city
lights constant living never stopped
aunt jessica warned take care
youre sweet little lamb honey city full wolves dear
dont ever trust none specially theyre men
chrissy never felt scared company others walked
traffic choked main street outside best place find way
chrissy already discovered essential feature cities always bigger ground appear
people walked place even fewer walked pleasure
debris littered pavements roads ruled traffic
passed drivers clocked young girl wearing scruffy old clothes walking briskly erect towards unknown destination forgotten next junction
another pretty girl city full
big city divided districts unknown chrissy crossed boundary docklands district
heading towards sea passed rows tall warehouse buildings blank windowless sides
main highway spun tangent suddenly found large empty road
speeding cars trucks sped gust exhaust fumes
sound engines clattered echoed grey buildings
sky strip half light hanging street lights
no living thing seemed
road ended abruptly deserted large intersection railway line ran embedded tarmac along dockyard front
ahead chrissy see looming hulks several large ships lay tied alongside quay
tall warehouses covered loading bays rusty metal clad walls stood opposite ships
trains railway trucks waited orderly rows
gantries cranes towered bathed glare orange sodium lights shut night
occasional trucks rounded corner crawled along roadway distance
little movement close although lights peered ships moored quay
steel hawsers rusty machinery crates stacks wooden pallets
distance men busy shouting whistling loading large dull rusty red cargo ship
small plink lap water betrayed sea becalmed within docks
chrissy turned walked slowly quayside away lights men towards open bay
darkness covered followed glistening steel rails stretched along centre road
short distance passed heard low whistle one buildings
turned saw nothing
perhaps imagined
moment later another louder whistle behind
walked ahead quickly shadow stepped silently dark roadside stood path
heart pounding tense chrissy stopped dead
shadow spoke strange slurred drawl
goes
voice questioned
dont know
chrissy became aware shadows closing around found surrounded half dozen young men dressed black
stood legs apart menacingly silent
terrified spun around look
large truck turned corner drove towards
boys blinked foolishly ran suddenly appeared melting shadows different direction
chrissy ran heart thumping side road darted back towards street lights ships
truck slowed stop continued way
chrissy ran corner road town
turned hands gripped tight empty behind
walked briskly almost run daring look back city streets encounter strangers
found way aunts apartment let slammed door behind massive sigh
hands trembled fear tried lock
went bed sleep
mind filled shadows blackness surrounding
much later aunt jessica returned drunk alone night city
coming chrissys room shouted wheres sleeping beauty
wait wait boys get soon enough
youll wish plain jane instead instead
mirror mirror wall
thought chrissy pretended asleep
come city never thought beautiful attractive realised
next day aunt announced going holiday seaside chrissy go
chrissy know make idea accepted stay big city alone
become bored lethargic apartment
aunt rude short tempered least interested tales countryside
aunt jessica critical chrissys father letting situation farm get hand
spent much time congratulating picking pieces
chrissy never met selfish person felt sad annoyed arrogant woman ruled life
whenever jessica brought home man chrissy banned sight
chrissy expected look work around flat
aunt jessica cooked rudimentary convenience meal day lived snacks sweets rest time
woman no interests beyond beautifying spend hours soaking bath sitting room applying layers powders cremes ageing face
underneath strata artifice aunt jessica attractive beauty wasted
painted face heavily emerged dressed city looked like clown
chrissy thought pathetic
five days week aunt jessica worked office city
returned evening always complaining people worked work
farm people no idea hard real job drawled puffs smoked another cigarette
pay day going ball
broke dont help pretty
costing fortune thats no lie
didnt bring extra money suppose honey
voice took cajoling tenderness moment
no replied chrissy
supposed
guess honey mores pity
aunt jessica sighed
chrissy began despise woman taken trapped
go back farm
money return parents able support even return
situation hopeless
became sullen lazy summer wore impending holiday drew ever closer
one day chrissy asked aunt jessie wheres river
aunt stared strangely replied aint no river town sweetheart
must
river comes
dont daft girl aunt jessica said
river know
ive lived life
anyway rivers dried know conversation ended
chrissy went whenever partly escape boring apartment disinterested aunt partly explore city

search party combed area monday without success
discoveries excited greatly

finder may found crystal mythrass box
disappeared like four sailors
adventure befallen final sunday
importance caves sgurr cavan
next day visited friend frank persuaded come temple winds search caves
prepared adventure carefully
packed torch compass
despite warm weather knew cool caves packed warm clothes plenty provisions knapsacks
climb centre island began early
long trek promised return nightfall
calculated twelve hours sunset take several hours walking way complete journey
frank walked hill edge oldford crossed old bridge across head gorge marked path river
river flowed opening low rock cliff lay head gorge
waters gathered marshes moors found way underground point
made way swiftly first along well used paths tracks threaded around many small fields orchards lay hills
several islanders harvesting crops fruit hops waved passed
jolly time fresh apples eat
walking along imagined rev
finder probably trodden paths years ago
weather fine sun rose sky day became warm
dew soaked bracken nettles grass beside paths slowly dried
looked across gently rising plain caught glimpses distant sea reflecting blue skies
refreshing sea breeze blowing across hillside cooled heat
four miles inland lush green surrounded farmsteads gave way rockier terrain
seldom used paths thereabouts became harder walk along
hour half steady walking found foot central hills
stopped refreshments surveyed scene vantage point fields
mid morning started climb hillside
paths follow often became indistinct wound across rocky outcrops
formation hills island like shelf full books half fallen sides
alternate steep rocky escarpments shallow rising pastures built fairly orderly manner towards central point
area deer gardens large herd red deer roamed across rocks pastures
sgurr cavan however different formation towered craggy haphazard fashion like giant cairn stone
dense dark almost black gabbro pierced skies
sharp ragged silhouettes rock buttresses erupted moors surmounting tawny mellow heather covered hues lower limestone slopes
even bright sun summers day sgurr cavan looked somehow cold forbidding
rock climbing necessary reach top careful footing imperative
circumnavigated jutting outcrop series steep ravines led inevitably towards central peak
runnels loose stone scree sharp glass covered steep sides valleys
deep fissures often contained narrow running streams fairly galloped slopes gathered forces reaching base hill drained peaty marshes coast
valleys rocks home goats sheep summer months passed shepherds fire circles built sheltered places
higher went colder became glad warm jackets
like many hills seen distance sgurr cavan larger higher prospect reality
sun passed zenith time frank finally walked broad corrie knife edged ridge ran summit
huge bowl shaped corrie bleak place black grey
waterfalls tumbled rocks centre
point large flat topped rock around five streams met tumbled pool
must crystal pillar stood
climbing top standing small level platform maybe ten feet across
tiny cairn loose rock invisible assembled top
normally bad luck disturb cairn leave
took rocks apart search
nothing
carefully rebuilt cairn dropped back floor corrie
ten minutes steep clambering beside one streams brought top
ecstatic tired
room sit steady unceasing wind
first time either reached top although often clambered around lower slopes
exhilaration achieving summit superb
temple wind shouted
answer voice wind blew even stronger gusts salty freshness sea
exhilarated moment made wish upon wind wish go across sea find perfect friend land big city
stood flying hair ruddy cheeks facing cold blast moving
cold even summer stay still long
frank found sheltered place close rocky path ascended
sat ate hearty lunch bread rolls cheese meat salad accompanied wholesome cordial
felt strong happy
see world knew top hill
air clear crystal great distances shrank eyes
direction mainland see big city neatly laid like perspective map far distance
buildings reflected sun million glass eyed windows
roads visible web dull black threads
tangled maze streets near centre gave way grid like suburbs outskirts
detail evaporated distance smoky heat haze hovered pall grimy cloud streets impression complete
eye looked inexorably first time see beyond big city land lay great plain reaching many miles inland
wonder see beyond plain distant mountains
almost blur haze quite definite make glimmer snow caps glinting across high ridges
view never forget
eaten climbed summit
followed horizon around past sweep mainland bays facing opposite direction
sea stretched seemingly forever horizon blended sky featureless azure arc
stood silence gazing realised time pressing
come frank cried must find came
replied
sure finders caves must far side summit towards newbridge
direction coast much nearer sea caves tunnelled inland
laboriously made way far side sgurr cavan
difficult pick path
scree dense treacherous no streams follow side summit
no sign caves rocky terrain either
little lower cliffs waterfalls scree tumbled
dangerous go see rev
finder gone way
decided descend cliffs one side try
working way around scrambled scraped way edge high moors possible approach base cliffs
many large boulders close far edge offered shelter little vegetation grew
stunted gnarled old trees no larger bushes cowered beside dark rocks shadow wind
tufts grass moss clutched clefts cracks stones
found numerous small openings behind trees
one thought found mouth cave succession proved little deep depression rock
suddenly frank shouted across two boulders little way slope
harry think hear water
ran across crawled small gap
faint metallic chime running water echoed deep nothing visible
long way said
must cave
think weve found
whispered
get
lets look around said might way lower
clinging edge slope feel head lightening effect vertigo
began climb hillside rocks difficult negotiate
scree loose boulders covered mountainous incline rattled runnels beneath feet
struggled harder became retain foothold handhold
began feel unsafe
must two hundred feet summit way cave still eluded
lets go back shouted frank
no good
dont think scree unstable
replied frank trod another loose boulder lost footing
slid tumbling hillside surrounded avalanche sharp grey grit
lay flat ground small rocks washed past
looking shouted
frank frank
no reply
dust settled no sign frank disappeared
began ease way cautiously slowly slowly like crab
suddenly saw saw frank stood
sliding scree uncovered entrance small cave miraculously frank dropped safety boulders bounded harmlessly
seconds later stood beside friend despite torn clothes unhurt
cave entrance small opened larger chamber
sun shone mouth cave gave enough light see back little way
prepared explore took torch
progress tunnel slow first became used darkness cool echoing shadows
felt increasingly insecure deepening dark ventured sight daylight
often glanced back velvet black behind
spoke low whisper avoid overheard
magic cave slowly overcame fear
entered small passage led towards centre hill
tunnel dropping
ancient walls carved solid rock wondered man nature made
hear clink drip water distance coming ever closer sound running stream
passage twisted several times seemed becoming smaller
roof low stoop continue along tunnel
feel lost one way go checking little compass found still heading towards centre hill
passage ended suddenly found standing gallery looking black void
torch revealed floor falling away mirroring roof curved
torch beam weak illuminate full extent cavern entered
stood awe struck enormity hollow mountain discovered
rock passageways dark indistinct colour walls cavern
dark
high single shaft sunlight blazed fissure roof
perhaps crack first looked
light beam pierced blackness like glowing rod struck wall
gasped saw place
wall alive radiance colour
light cascaded like furnace brilliant jewels
dancing sparkling beams shone waterfall myriad rainbows reflected roof rippling patterns cast large pool
beautiful thing grasped mind wall behind pool point rainbows ended massive eruption liquid clear white crystal
somewhere inside began understand mystery mythras mountain
found white crystal magical
frank stood rocky gallery timeless moment silently watching display slowly changed
light sun shine fissure short time day small number days year
privileged witnesses moving experience
secret hill come light another day different time
easy believe glorious fate drawn cavern
felt sure mythras must known place light window
must come island find cave obtain crystal
decided take
find secrets mythras
awoke surreal dream surrounded turned frank
realised time cause crystal vanish light moved said excited whisper
must hurry light goes
need crystal
frank question desire
frank lead crept massive chamber began cross floor towards goal
part way across cavern foot stepped something loose rock
shone torch place gasped involuntarily
lying feet disjointed bones human skeleton
stooped looked unfortunate victim
no features former corpse left lying sand close coins
picked one date
put coin pocket
mind racing
last resting place reverend finder
happened lead death
looked skeleton
gaunt white arm lay stretched pointing towards depths cavern
empty eye sockets stared face
stared back transfixed vacant glare moment frank called
put thoughts mind crossed rocks frank stood edge pool
magic light playing upon face
reason felt unable tell skeleton found
ill tell later thought
reach crystal cross pool no way go around
knelt felt icy water shivered touch
pool long narrow
waterfall showered centre flowed sedately one end
away waterfall pool completely clear carefully shining torch see bottom shelved deeply around waterfall appeared shallow close edge
go said simply
hold rope
saying took rope knapsack frank uncoiled took trousers preparing wade water
tied rope chest arms
take no risks
stepped gingerly pool shocking cold water covered skin like plunging snow
feel smooth rock bare soles feet
felt thrill run waded around pool
spray mist waterfall constantly bathed water slowly rose knees moved towards crystal
pool deeper overflow drained strength current surprised
stopped brace flow ventured
approach cascade crystal took longer expected
crystal extended water floor pool became angular sharp facets remarkable stone
light seemed float flutter
crystal bright darkness hard look directly
became illuminated rainbows able touch stone last
hoped find loose pieces
stone impressively hard touch
smooth sharp glass firmer less brittle like clear flint
find broken stone took small hammer brought bag
tested sharp crystal blunt steel shower electric blue sparks flew hammerhead
chose point broken stone hoped fall water
shielded eyes one arm struck stone hard
crack hammer like gunshot echoed reverberation
light scattered momentarily piece precious rock fell
suddenly squealing rush dozens black shadows flew frantically whirling flapping past
heart missed beat
bats disturbed sound
perhaps taken omen forces stone release
picked piece broken
stone cold smooth heavy
perfect flat edges
laid hand looked glowing crystal
fitted snugly palm
tell light chamber changing fading fast
placed hammer crystal bag closed securely turning make way back
excitement forgotten freezing water
legs numb feel feet barely move
moment passed panic thought stuck cave
great effort started walk like slow awkward automaton towards shore frank patiently waited
shouted companion take slack small voice died vastness great chamber
journey back frank standing took long time
legs getting warmer feel whole body shivering uncontrollably cold
suddenly shadow blocked shaft light cave pitched blackness
involuntarily looked window
light returned saw dislodged stone dust floating cave receding beams light
felt even deeper shiver pass

twenty feet edge pool disaster struck
couldnt feel feet missed footing completely plunging edge underwater shelf
lost balance fell headlong icy cold darkness
frank called harry
freezing liquid rushed mouth nose felt head plunge surface
shock coldness icy water filled head struck sharp rocky floor pool
frank struggled rope
first move
clambering edge pool free rope edge rocky shelf pull water
tremendous effort pulled edge
desperately dragged cold wet body water
frank knelt limbs shaking cold

voice seemed come nearer
became aware awakening though long deep dream
felt tired wanted pull bed covers go back sleep
cold head ached
world became clearer half darkness cave mystery
understand turned last looked fading shaft light high chamber
frank shouted feebly right
somehow thought frank trouble confusion soon gave way reality cold
raised slowly knees
frank supported struggled dress
felt nauseous strangely light headed
realisation accident subterranean lake infiltrated numbed head felt angry falling
shivering cold began subside covered every layer clothing
legs itched ached distressing sensation burning feeling returned
lifted packs slowly painfully retraced steps past silent witness skeleton cave entrance
every step head pounded pain shot legs
outside last blinked stupidly
frank stared head gasped
harry head

well clean later
gash skull left hair matted blood
cold shocked even felt
late afternoon sun felt warmth last something inside deliriously happy
help franks astonishment laughed aloud felt fresh new freedom enter heart
expedition succeeded
remember magical underground kingdom crystal light rest days
respected memory kept secret forever
exhilaration moment warmth sun relieved pain
frank tumbled scree landed rather ungainly fashion firm ground
no longer felt danger
adventure cave outside world seemed innocent homely
stood dusted
suddenly frank hissed pointed summit sgurr cavan

frank turned corner
years saw island
walked old flagstone path pushed half open stable door
strode kitchen
must looked sight
mother shrieked saw scolded laughed
told adventure left reference possible danger skeleton
scolded seemed satisfied cleaned bruised gashed head took away bedraggled clothes
hid precious white crystal went bed early
suddenly felt overwhelmingly tired
climbing stairs tumbled onto bed slept
came no surprise awoke severe chill remained bed nearly week
wild dreams infested fever later mother told babbled strange tales crystal lights caverns
smiled meekly said nothing
like leave crystal might found carried everywhere
kept small leather pouch pocket
spent hours gazing strange beautiful stone found
wondered unleash magical power thought possessed
sometimes crystal catch light reflect spectrum colour
sometimes found staring stone forgetting everything around
seemed drawn crystal like waking dream head filled strange words spoken unknown voice live stone world still apart life unknown earth heart
many long years ever mysterious traveller across deep sea
stand clear dawn master time enter caverns revealing crime
older history filled strange light touching cold mystery inside deep night
thoughts deeds vision sight
father told friend frank visited delirium say good bye family departed new house
saddened first broken friendship

sat buttoned jacket turned heavy leather pouch pocket
rain swept across sea obliterated view

old eric turned go
watched old sea dog walk along quay wind rain ran hill home
chapter four double cross ancient stalwart house massive castle
cold stone floors echoed sound thunder rumbling peals great rooms
torrential shower rain obscured view windows
high walls flared electric white lightning crackled past close
storm cut power grey monstrous building lay shadow
mullioned windows set high ground pierced stone walls
slate roofs stretched gloom
shaggy masses moss carpeted tiles old twining creepers fanned fingers across walls
outlines turrets towers half hidden mists streaming rain
eerie abode hugged lower slopes tree covered hillside foothills snowy mountains
range upon range ever higher hills precipice upon precipice piled behind
somewhere distance high snow covered peaks capped icy white even height summer
evening storm driven inland across plains rattling hills mark end long hot summer
water filled gullies smoothed cracked baked clay
tired streams began flow brown creamy frothing liquid
earth breathed sweet smell rain soaked soil smothered fields
around water released new perfumes pine woods wild herbs scented undergrowth
fungi mushroomed overnight woody tilth
creatures world took shelter woods hedges holes
violence opening scene gave way gentler play
new softer rain caressed countryside cooling feathery touch
life returned fields forests brown turned green
everywhere leaves dripping burnt umber parched earth received abundance heaving sighs gratitude
hill farmers farmhouses slept smiles upon faces dreams fixed plough tilled red ochre soil scythed lush grass ready changing year come
high hill electric light restored old house seemed cast softer shadow
no sinister murk adorned lofty towers
instead dull grey limestone friendly welcoming shower
ages time lay easily stones even builder intended twenty generations
hilly place source streams fed tributaries led rivers snaked plains
wild world still ruled shadows mountains
wolves roamed deep woods searching lost sheep
bears hunted sweet honey bees nests searched quiet caves winter sleep
rocks trembled time time sending avalanches scree washing valleys like dark chattering rivers stone
wilful rocks heaved mountain building continued
possible traverse inhospitable snowy mountains months summer
old drove road climbed great pass wound way tree line snaked high peaks air thin eagle flew alone sky
no towns people mountains
home ancient tribe hidden away remote valleys
people simple tough
farmed sheep goats hilly pastures tree line
shepherds brought sheep hills spring took back lower valleys late autumn approached
true people hills lived solitary almost silent lives
moved shelter shelter grazing sheep
shepherds rejoin families winter lived together small hamlets foothills
erebos large house built long ago rich city man lay edge one shepherd hamlets
summer palace escape
empty derelict many years place snakes bears found shelter
one day took interest man desire live apart men
old yet tired
traveller many years
felt need seek nature held power place close mountains felt something older man still controlled earth
eccentric man ignored shepherds time mild curiosity waned
people came know old man mountain true name sicarius known
needed name called wolfe
lived many years gathered herbs woods minerals valleys
walked hills made charts notes observed
curious man filled great house collections
service number short swarthy strangers arrived far away lands
spoke foreign tongue kept apart
every week cart brought supplies valley provide small household
small community survived unchanged many years
occasionally wolfe go away sometimes months house closed always returned
saw remarked never appeared older yet no one place age
seemed timeless man
bleak outward appearance house deceptive
principal rooms furnished comfortably tastefully obvious expense
suites rooms upper floors equally luxurious every modern contrivance available
many rooms available use yet remained empty mystery knew existence
wolfe ran estate methodical perfectionist zeal
maintained buildings land exceptional standard
within lower floors great house secrets known one
many crates packages filled storerooms vaults beneath main building
shelves lined walls rooms
rows carefully labelled boxes stacked ceiling high
labels written strange language coded complex numbers
concealed contained
meticulous collector kept doors rooms locked unless present
erebos foundations stone hills
behind doors deepest vault wide passageway led wall solid rock containing doorway
within stone arch door made material appearance stone smoothness glass
no handle lock apparent exterior surface door opened hidden mechanism
beyond door lay workings old mine
passageways hewn rock needed no support
old man spent many hours behind closed door depths hill
strange new symbol double cross silver green background replaced coats arms adorned outside house gates
motto encircled symbol read ego sum dominus temporis
device marked every box package stores
library complete shelf full large leather bound books symbol tooled onto spines covers
every item furniture glassware pottery tools cutlery implement possessed identifying mark either ostentatious decoration subtle insignia
sign double cross embracing within walls estate
morning storm wolfe stood topmost tower great house looked across world
rain washed clean air given clarity crystal
horizon morning sun caught receding showers beneath arc rainbow
wolfe wore tattered cloak embroidered double cross
flowing white hair blew morning breeze old face looked troubled
seemed searching far horizon something
one hand held long staff capped silver held box
long time passed move stood silently watching waiting
solitary black speck appeared horizon moved swiftly towards tower
small black bird swept across skies grew great crow landed upon highest roof house
looked black eyes black beak old man
bird uttered single broken croak dropped something gleaming beak gathered flew back towards horizon
wolfe turned go walked stairway
went spoke quietly strong steady voice
time come last strided stairs
days followed house became place great activity
servants prepared guest rooms
folded stowed dust sheets
transports arrived carrying supplies food drink
small household expanded arrival dozen new helpers appeared countrymen existing staff
staff never talked working
remained mute evening hot kitchens babbled together strange tongue
clear house prepared number guests old man seen
made way smooth stone door old mines
far house hillside acrid smoke rose unseen fissures
ready old man stood courtyard first light welcomed guests
one journeyed separately
arrived foot forests hills
travelled great distance appeared dishevelled shepherds wearing old grey cloaks tough leather jerkins
wolfe stood gate first approached
welcome said outstretched arm indeed good see long time
come
first arrive
wolfe replied guest firmly shaking hand long journey pleased last
six
five came intervals day slipped quietly gates
one arrived dead night old man stood waiting ancient porch
greeted traveller fashion neither equal yet superior one stood apart civil host
servants escorted quarters
night torch blazed door old man waited patiently one never come
wolfe guests assembled dining hall midday meal
one week rains begun
scene magnificent
pale light filtered stained glass windows spread coloured patterns across table set banquet
servants carried beautifully prepared dishes kitchens
waiters dressed handsome livery blue silver served meal
six guests sat opposite three row old man occupied head table
empty place laid foot table
guests no longer wore country clothes dressed striking garments
one different colour design
appeared like uniforms generals former generations embroidered waistcoats coloured sashes
six transformed unkempt hair unshaven faces emerge strong sophisticated yet wise men lords double cross
ancient order usually eschewed excess finery favour research philosophy
occasionally met formal guise pursued work elders
colour garments matched titles lords blue lord truth red lord knowledge emerald lord friendship purple lord destiny violet lord faith gold lord freedom
wolfe wore white also dressed lord white lord reason
one company mythras lord mystery no colour
together made strength eight lords double cross
came far wide across land across sea like wolfe studied deeper arts life nature
meal extended afternoon much conversation travels exploits distant places
although rarely met together company seemed ease hearty withdrew parlour close
indulged beverages made herbs fruits mountains enhanced spices distant lands
usually silent old man host become animated lively
long time passed convivial conversation old man stood glass hand spoke
friends asked purpose mind voice became serious slow
time act
fear white crystal found
assembled six attended earnestly old man continued
know one holds knowledge fact white crystal no longer legend
purveyors magic suspicion
yet seems science thing acts magic
beyond understanding dangerous thing
one crystal undoubtedly believes magic undoubtedly thinks master
tried magic succeeded others failed
thinks discovered secret stone
leave use power alone voice rose spoke
dangerous
must bring white crystal must safe guarded
nobody else may know thing balance world surely undone
thundered
company murmured together uneasily
six lords looked towards silent companion stood quiet grim contemplation
white lord continued know live place time
mythras need guidance mystery
blue lord stepped forward spoke deep measured voice
news bring council elders
mythras dead elders elected wish white lord lord reason take place mythras lord mystery day
bring token office
blue lord stood back line others waited wolfe speak
things come lifetime
elders wisdom chosen wisely
accept office moment
tell wolfe returns thanks take token office safe keeping
mythras dead yet lives
blue lord handed small wooden box symbol double cross inlaid lid
wolfe held box spoke issue first order new authority
must take matter forward
must prepare journey
go rooms meet together one hour chamber moon
appointed time seven gathered small chamber high tower
no ordinary room painted deep blue wide windows seven eight walls
sat around old octagonal table wolfe spoke
tell something history behind thing said may decide path future
long ago council elders appointed one mythras worthy
necromancer wise within rotten ambition
man become mythras virtue great knowledge mysteries undoubted also claimed found new science secret temporal change
simply put power time
council elders foresaw indeed control time also powerful possibly dangerous
appointed mythras order bound rule lords double cross always serve preserve good world
devised strength eight ensure others always aware mythras activities
no certainty whether mysteries claimed mythras true records showed thought unlikely magicians trick
council also saw power mythras claimed used good well evil true desired use science ends
council commanded lords double cross watch mythras discover possess secret insisted
mythras determined science illusion temporal change particular material manufactured create effect desired
think correct
however although knew formula magic possess substance
journeyed known world tested every material find
built laboratory tried create perfect substance raw materials around
used cauldrons molten lava collected active volcanoes distilled pure substances precious stones no avail
science world many centuries behind thought attempts synthesise substance vain
exactly mean temporal change
asked blue lord
know sure effect change pace time
clocks made work forwards backwards
may seemed trick first experienced effect proved real unbalancing
events many things become possible
seemingly impossible attained
replied wolfe
tremor excitement usually controlled voice
man ever succeed quest
asked gold lord
always believed although never proven thus dilemma
accounts travelling magician accounts handed many generations no doubt much altered embroidered across years
pioneer many pioneers perished hands science
indeed succeed may entered impossible circumstance perished
necessarily worked alone
claimed material required specialised crystal kind timing master synthesised earthly materials
gave no hint might found
days use quartz crystals regulate time maybe clue
fell favour
council elders eventually stripped man office
records show council felt achieve claim time outcast charlatan
man went journeying became travelling magician little entertainer
however council trust always sent follower wisely turned
many years passed travelling magician eventually went island named suidhe coast big city disappeared
never appear
blue lord questioned
magician never appeared guise
years later old wealthy man died mainland
amongst possessions many gathered known world world known house
left leader council elders
still exists seen
paragraph relating house note attached addressed specifically council stated rambling fashion house contained thing council looked years
short inferred magic crystal
magic stone found asked emerald lord believe fallen hands
stolen
no
white crystal never found house
never possession believe thing thought
indeed according one white crystal eight one
many years searched white crystals knowledge power supposedly possess
failed also tried find formula material question
seems however ability explicate science contained stones died old man
lifetime search research failed reveal method temporal change
illogical
much seems illogical found nature
understand appears magic
forbears no understanding electricity lightning magnetism elements science
explained myths imagination
whole religions devised explain circumstances world place within
knowledge hard shift legend mistaken truth
prefer fact research understanding science
know magician make crystals found
magician find white crystal
asked red lord
know certainty replied wolfe
believe crystals found somewhere suidhe magician disappeared
indeed believe key disappearance
alas despite many enquiries searches island never found source indeed one
looked
history days become legend unreliable
clues might led place lost destroyed great storm
great war led many years darkness elders obliged move attentions elsewhere
makes sure white crystal found
questioned gold lord
still one man island remembers something elder days helps time time replied wolfe
tells boy island made discovery recently
believes discovery crystal
boy stays island sure controlling thing
short journey big city
teenage boy vulnerable many temptations
must find boy quickly sure safety know others world ambitions power wish find
gold lord looked
others
asked
inferred people strong strange belief
fanatic claim things
dangerous evasive
descended original follower sent council
white crystal found must determine whence came protect sake future generations
must protect boy keep others bay
ancient modern play upon fields time unless much mistaken
saying wolfe turned gold lord gave papers tied scroll
maps papers help find boy island
must leave first light seek
choose one accompany make preparations
gold lord chose take emerald lord mission
left room returned chambers night
violet lord purple lord return council elders inform come pass day
also inform council take action safeguard secrets known
must protect people
danger boy secure
without speaking purple lord violet lord turned together prepared leave great house
within hour two men appeared courtyard
dressed grey brown coats dark leather hats
pass common travellers
walked gates turned path separated
soon vanished mists hung hazy vaporous curtains across valleys
one duty said wolfe perhaps dangerous duty perform
turned remaining two lords looked silently moment
duty
asked red lord
must go find others spoke replied wolfe
others also seek white crystal
easy wish alert
ruthless men
look three
two paid thugs third key
harder find
think yet know concerns know boy
informants sure looking person
must go divert gaze time secure future
willing
ready lords replied
wolfe
white lord
mythras
remain tasks perform
far omens good thank saying wolfe placed hands shoulders men turned left room
night passed sun cast first shadows day red lord blue lord left house
slipped silently away unseen woods going way towards future
travel place powers lived big city
left wolfe bade farewell gave small book verses
often order words provided solutions else fails
lines use times trouble come elder days said
read
old man mountain wolfe white lord reason become mythras lord mystery stood steeped thought silence
companions left went library consulted many old books making notes drawing diagrams
finished tasks took refreshment walked cellars approached stone door
door swung open within dark passages coolness filtered
wolfe entered tunnel door closed behind
turned string lights illuminated long narrow passageway mountain
old man strode forward short distance passageway curved sharply right downhill
sense direction soon lost tunnel spiralled deeper
coolness upper galleries gave way acrid uncomfortable smell pervaded everywhere
rock walls changed colour light brown grey metallic deep magenta
wolfe walked steadily footsteps echoing descended
another noise slowly became louder
deep muffled pumping sound
passage time dropped far base mountain spiral tunnel eventually ended second door
door opened ahead old man entered cavern
livid red glow leapt within
chamber deep slow pulse pervasive coupled high hiss escaping steam sounded like giant slow steam engine
wolfe moved forward across sweltering space
size shape small ship
smell sulphur hung air small clouds steam issued vaporously hidden vents
cavern empty lay irregular masses globular rock
one side pipes presses chimneys workbenches gathered around laboratory
places great rock pillars stretched roof ledges platforms jutted walls centre monstrous pit
fissure red glow emerged point wolfe threaded way
centre cavern intensely hot
wolfe reached edge chasm stood high rock carved look like giant lectern overhung cauldron
looked opening
glare molten rock reflected white robes
reason house built mountain
forge first owner hoped yield magic temporal change heat strength melt rock totally destroy make anew
tumult within furnace loud molten rock boiling leaping crashing back crusty red surface
wolfe noted lava active seen active
turned leave no experiments day
swiftly made way back across chamber door
door closing heard felt blast explosion within chamber
dropped floor mighty rock door slammed shut behind
beneath feet felt faint tremor rock first time life wolfe scared
powerful man amongst men powers contained within earth men insignificant
substance rock energy core planet part greater scheme things part cosmos
quickly wolfe returned along passageway house sealed great stone door
outside stopped drew breath
even earth seemed sense time change hand
no tremors day wolfe contented planning future
future moment seemed uncertain thought six wise lords moving towards allotted places filled mind hope
wolfe sat library surrounded shelves ancient books
two cats one black one white lay curled chairs one end room
table beside well thumbed volume
hand written journal
opened marked page read words
day come mythras return
many signs portend day
look

closed book said mythras ancient fool
picked small wooden box received elders double cross upon investiture

chapter five big city clock ticked loudly room
went bed sleep
threw bedclothes lay staring wide eyed darkness
got paced room
often went window looked across sea towards mainland
opened window wider try catch breeze air still heavy
storm rising distance rain soon coming
clouds veiled far away coast wanted see
three times went bed three times rose
felt excited
feeling inside never experienced half nervous tension strange smiling power deep within made tremble exhilaration
imagined walking water sea mainland
time appeared stopped night walked around small room
clock moved slowly
mind racing thoughts flashed head even lightning distant rumble filtered window
curtains fluttered breeze heralded storm come
tense clouds seemed infiltrate feelings flash decided go
went cupboard pulled old duffel bag
stopped take
minutes filled warm clothes drawer biscuits kitchen
first drops heavy rain sputtered onto glass crept silently back room
went bed fourth time night
sound thunder reverberated ears listen
felt satisfied calm time slept
awoke five oclock morning
air clear everything outside heavy nights rain
excited scared determined go plan
day third september saturday morning
boat less crowded weekend thought
quickly quietly dressed put money much wallet collected things
wrote quick note father gone adventure back bedtime placed mantelpiece dining room going quietly back upstairs
crept window jumped rocky bank behind house landed silently soggy wet moss
knew no one else awake see
early morning outside cool fresh beautiful
dawn rising clouds rosy horizon walked swiftly deserted street
harbour still empty quiet
almost high tide full grey sea rolling slowly along base harbour wall
gulls rode lazily waves flotilla grey white black marble eyes watched passed
old harbour walls built boulders rough hewn stone sat squat heavy strong
know going sure something get mainland
found place hide away one niches settled wait
determined hold white crystal needed board boat
confident succeed
fresh banks clouds slid silently across dome sky shut beautiful delicate pale blue
new morning replaced old grey damp hint autumn air carried cooling breeze
peace island around sat stony alcove beneath harbour wall
looking listened quiet except slow slosh sea sound wind ears
excitement danger felt woke dissipated place felt calm even happy
realised sitting determined leave island true home good place live
felt emotion belonging holding island like strange magnetism
hour passed time harbour slowly came life
men came work
hear familiar voices prepared landing stage ferry
across waves yet unseen boat approaching mainland
one men saw sitting wall waved
part scenery people expected
waved back hand pocket fingered pouch holding precious stone
continued vigil distance caught sight solitary figure
standing close empty old house perches cliffs high hill far side harbour
stood still looking boats wondered
looking
looked sea saw ferry come view harbour entrance
rusty black hull ploughed water leaving white foamy wash rippling across slow murky waves
black exhaust stained air short stubby red funnel captain manoeuvred vessel channel swinging buoys
thrubbing ferrys engines grew louder small ship rounded harbour wall drew alongside quay
engines revved roughly reverse water surged around hull
men called secured ropes bollards quayside
gently boat eased rest engines stopped harbour quiet
saturday rest day trickle passengers crossed ferry landing stage
counted six men
dock workers busy hour afterwards unloading grey sacks post pallets cargo onto waiting trailers
hold empty began stow boat crates fish farm produce parcels destined big city
weather turned foul dark clouds blanketed sky repressive gloom
rain poured punctuated sound thunder rolling across sea
handful passengers arrived board ferry stood sheltering teeming rain small shelter dock
recognised took care remain sight
waited crew raised boarding sign first passengers went small wooden ticket office gangway onto deck
quayside almost deserted
incessant rain swept squally pulses across docks
shelter alcove ineffectual soon dripping cold
see crew passengers looking boat
get board act
slipped crystal leather pouch palm hand
repeated spell
ego sum dominus temporis
three times said strange sleepy drugged feeling came
picked duffel bag moved gloom day
feel brow prickly flushed sweat stepped quayside
trembling walked towards ticket office
hail rain poured torrents
sky mass dark boiling cloud
strangely dark even stormy day
reached spot yards barrier
stopped
move
thunder around town
final passenger already boarded ahead
head felt heavy looking see several passengers crew looking straight
nerve shattered
shivering turn run away
suddenly rending explosion
air crackled white heat lightning struck
air filled steam
deaf
blind
feel whole body vibrate hum
think may screamed
head pounded
overtaken dark panic thought left ran ran straight ahead
vision returned
see shadows rushed towards vessel
distant muffled sound echoed ears
someone deck shouting
people saloon crowded round windows looking standing seconds
ran straight past ticket office two officers ship crashed gangway quay
stop
ran deck hoarse shivering shock
rain streamed face filled eyes
alone
shaking hands barely grip deck rail turned looked back quayside
two ships officers bending something quay others running across town
looked like body lying ground
long time nothing happened
men stood away earnestly talking stared gloom
two officers returned slowly towards ferry people came town
another flash lightning drew eyes hills sharp silhouette figure stood storm
shrank back gangway deck shelter amongst ropes canvas
suddenly felt impossibly tired
sat old tarpaulin closed eyes
first opened eyes panicked
nowhere
everything white
perhaps dead
no boat ferry
sat
right
stiff cold crawled hiding place
clouds encircled boat everything seemed close vague fog
wet murky dream world reality disappeared
felt completely alone sounds muffled grumble engines screeching gulls
visibility reduced feet strange white light enveloped everything
fog curtailed senses began wonder boarded ghost ship
ghost board
head hurt terribly felt nauseous
press back hiding place sit shivering
every minutes caught muttering ego sum dominus temporis
embracing clouds clung clammy tenacity
senses afloat
references gone
eerie echoing unseen gulls followed boat like aerial spirits crying wind
tell hearing right wrong
time seemed telescope white world
terrible moment thought back quay
reflected events hour
really
white crystal done back
body quay

moment panicked
head clearing white light getting brighter around
matter
ferry big city
change came suddenly fog bank billowed away behind ferry emerged bright sunshine
contrast unnerving
blinds lifted eyes ears no longer deaf
monochrome world burst brilliant life
clear space filled mind colour soaked eyes sky sapphire blue sea aquamarine
sun already warming face
space minute whole world changed completely
aching head cleared miraculously fresh new confidence
bright morning light made squint blink
looked around across sparkling waves place never really seen
ferry less mile big city harbour
buildings towered skyline
glass walls reflected sky dazzling display jet emerald
peak upon peak mountainous sky scrapers ranged back heart city
closer harbour alive vessels arriving leaving
derricks cranes lined docksides
ships massive bulk wallowed wharves waiting cranes disgorge treasured cargoes
pleasure boats yachts skimmed across waters criss crossing harbour marina forests masts rigging slapping lay tangled morning sky
two dolphins arced dove alongside ferry
sleek bodies dazzled brilliant display playful mastery sea
thought world seemed wear fresh happy smile moment new pleasure
bold bright buildings grew magnificence stature ferry closed terminus
cars trucks freeways gleamed processed ceaseless multitude across six lane deck suspension bridge
rose curved across harbour entrance single perfect majestic span imitating dolphins raced
far see smoky stacks factories distant glint metalwork strung webbing silver pipes
chimneys like great twisted candles spouted yellow red white smoke sky
giant cylindrical tanks sprawled sea
knew talks frank edifice great bay oil refinery
watched things sense awe wonder ferry came dock
like stepping forward time
realised suidhe old also old fashioned
island formed different era history ferry like time machine future sea
closer boat came shore less overall picture see clearer detail became
like huge jigsaw hundreds pieces formed every part
hum city came across water like sound hive
engine oil sulphur smarted sense smell
sound engines thrummed ears gleam steel glared eyes
things tantalised senses new delights
even fresh warmth sun appeared increase close dry heat came near city
glistening green black glass terminal building lay welcome like vast iridescent beetle
passengers came onto deck ferry stood small group around gangway chatting together others quietly watching
no one noticed silently waiting place stern
wasnt
boat docked smoothly calmly precision born confidence regularity
gangway dropped engaged terminus walkway ferry engines slowed idle
watched passengers walk casually gaping hall building away
seemed disappear vastness place
no one watching ferry seemed least interested
got
time felt steady clear headed
walked round deck gangway across walkway building
didnt look either side went
strangely feel nervous
sure fine
shining stone floor seemed doubly solid still gently rolling deck ferry
no ticket collectors empty booths walked
arrived big city
walked centre great hall stood gazed
looked around across
place unlike anything seen
kiosks benches lined walls lights reflected marble floors
nothing appeared support glinting glass roof magic
pigeons fluttered artificial sky others ambled lamely smooth ground pecking picking small item food
place universe
nameless music echoed reverberated occasionally punctuated unintelligible announcement spoken robotic female voice
voice emanated nowhere spoke no one people ignored
arrays giant lights spread artificial daylight thin air inside despite sun blazed blue sky
building appeared contrived artificial yet magnificent place like modern palace
notice people first around kiosks within waiting rooms sat men women boys girls
seemed insignificant vast hall
knew ships went coast across ocean
traffic saturday light still early
many people silent statues almost nothing
read newspapers hiding behind broadsheets looked ground seemingly deep thought stared vacantly glazed eyes waited passing time
cleaner walked lazily past pushing giant broom meandering across floor whistling went
two old men scruffily dressed shuffled across rubbish bin rummaged detritus inside
walked disappointed mumbled incoherently
rolled coat lying black formless ragged bench contained man asleep
big city people silent grey inanimate
thought
grim mouths empty eyes
watched yawning waiting numbers clock clicked interminably
heart cheered saw large smiling woman dressed apron cap
leaning across clean metal counter kiosk talked flamboyant gestures old grey man sitting stool drinking tea
itll lead no good see right saying man appeared ignore
cleaner walked interrupted harangue
ivy give tea luv sat another stool rested elbows bar top
realised hungry walked towards kiosk see snack buy
save rest biscuits later
reached place remembered crystal
hand time
even thought arose mind voice close behind called
turned involuntarily
yea
come ere
stood staring two young men black jackets black shiny hair black glasses blue jeans
almost carbon copies difference size comical
lean tall one spoken
thoughts magic instantly left slipped crystal hand leather pouch
remembered old eric told magic mainland
old eric seemed different world
must known thought
two sinister young men leaning steel railing beside escalator flowed sight
short fat one chewed grinned man beckoned across
like look either walked anyway
fat man spat gum mouth asked come
answer fat man started walk signalling follow
obediently followed man walked behind
suidhe island replied fat one laughed vicious scathing cackle
men kept walking
felt almost imperceptible movement beside fat one pointed something towards roof said look
stopped looked
followed pointing finger someone patted back
ivy kiosk looked three shouted hey leave hes kid
heard slight noise behind turned look thin man gone turned back way fat man disappearing escalator side hall
went kiosk
ivy cleaner looked sadly
wan keep away likes dear said ivy
theyll clean no time
mean
asked looked shook heads
asked cup tea biscuit felt pocket wallet gone
turned red embarrassment anger easily duped early day
no one ever told thieves didnt island

tea cake welcome ivy said
take advice go home something serious happens
couldnt imagine serious thanked drank tea left
checked pocket crystal still leather pouch sighed relief
although found promising start adventure decided time see city
franks new address piece paper intended make way destination
city one day catch evening ferry home survive without little money brought
two thieves disappointed counted haul
found way exit strode automatic glass doors onto pavement busy road alongside huge car park
weather changing sun invisible behind mounting grey clouds day still fair
parked taxis cars lined roadway
see bus station across way large yellow buses parked neatly beside shelters
bus different number name destination board
noise smell vehicles engulfed
felt walked monstrous mechanical farmyard
place squalid empty cans cigarette ends squashed packaging lay abandoned grimy pavements
despite constant arrival departure many vehicles struck people seemed going anywhere anything particular
everybody outside waited within
pavements beyond terminus seemed deserted
nobody walked big city everyone went car taxi bus
taken bus city centre without money no choice walk
started walking along road past bus station towards centre city
road built along top old stone causeway wide enough two lanes vehicles direction
fuming snake traffic crawling along towards distant junction freeway
walked past cars buses lorries looking one turn taking
never seen many vehicles one place even pictures
engines rattled whined brakes hissed squeaked
every minutes whole parade vehicles surge forward engines revving opening like giant concertina collapse squealing hissing tight stop
drivers vehicles leaned windows clutched wheels stared mirrors talked
oblivious world outside except vehicle front
occasionally irate horn blare someone shout although seemed no reason
freeway junction different
wider terminus road traffic never stopped raced past unceasingly pace barely distinguish vehicles one another
three lanes traffic flowed way rattling roaring stampede
pavement stopped abruptly junction nowhere go
stood front snarling morass traffic blinked stupidly glaring light wondered next
knew city centre lay beyond direction first started walk
see shining towers horizon impenetrable wall moving vehicles barring way
deep ditch wild terrain empty marshland lay either side road
bricks rubble erupted green slimy water muddy puddles
occasional half dead bush reed covered patch grew stubbornly desolation
uninviting place wilderness spread distance
green soupy water smelled decay surface buzzed angrily hordes insects
gas bubbles glooped surface dragonflies dipped danced air
looked frantic freeway turned away
seemed no alternative walk back way come
retraced steps surprise saw man grey coat wide brimmed hat standing path looking across wasteland
hurried past dark figure without looking
minutes later stood outside ferry terminus
looked back road saw two cars stop waiting man get first sped towards city
watched two men walked along road place man stood looking back towards
wore smart grey business suits
one red tie one blue
looked around different way go
one road slipped quietly away towards docks
no cars travelling train like parade parked lorries lined one side
followed road no footpath corner terminus building
turned first one way zig zagging large formless warehouses
main road numerous spurs led warehouses yards
occasionally lorry thunder past vibrating ground weight sped
see far direction towering warehouses around able make steady progress along road
dusty tarmac shady quiet footfall echoed featureless walls
although didnt appear signs clues direction guessed making way circuitous route toward city centre
stopped suddenly tie shoe lace distant hum traffic hear sound steps behind stopping
looked see no one
distance big city thing illusion
distance appears short seen start becomes progressively longer make way
docklands walking
try walking big city aware big
scale things quite wrong mere humans
land giants mechanical giants
aware available time passing quickly didnt seem getting closer destination
cursed thieves stolen money began despair ever seeing city centre
thought asking someone help no one ask place deserted except footpad still following
wary feeling growing inside
went around one right angled bend finally came across something different
felt cheered sight
ship
largest thing ever seen
even distance impressive vast black bulk filled quayside
approached monster open mouthed stood twenty feet away
deck high roof warehouse building
bridge rear vessel rose high
massive red funnel
hawsers thick mans body spiralled quayside close stood
turned towards city saw solitary man grey coat leaning gantry distance
face hidden shadows cast broad brim hat
appeared looking sea
man
decided speak satisfy curiosity
tall bird like cranes travelled rails length docks unloading ships
walked past vessels slow moving train overtook hooting approached
two dirty industrial engines pulling perhaps hundred wagons rumbled clanked clattered way towards end quay
grey man close side railway waited train pass
last wagon rolled away crossed lines man place empty no one visible
eternal spying eyes gulls wheeled air
uniform grey mass cloud covered sky every direction small cool breeze stirring ruffling tops murky green waves bay
rain drifted across drizzled mist blowing wind
heavier drops followed steady patter soon turned dusty road gleaming black lake
put hood huddled along faster
walked looked place cover stop let shower pass
splashed way side road relative shelter open warehouse loading bay sat deserted concrete plinth
took food munched way thoughtfully biscuits
carefully preserved later
great disappointment sky darkened still rain hailed gusto
avoid soaking stood backed shadows loading bay
rain descended like curtain across entrance way
stopped watched listening drumming rattle iron roof
noisy darkness heard another sound whistle
suddenly periphery vision shadows emerged gloom either side
tensed froze
seconds later six youths surrounded
remained silent watching
one stepped forward tall lad long unkempt hair
noticed wore worn brown leather boots faded sleeveless denim jacket
turned trousers short thin age
lad strong tattooed arms small podgy hands
one hand three fingers stabbed air front

two grey suited men distance walking slowly dock looking open doorway came
one red tie one blue
no replied
saw looking around ferry terminal
stepped back dark
time go
back way
take star chamber ordered tuffy
found dragged away instant
jostled along running pace long wet deserted alleys amidst buildings
twisting turning lost sense direction
tuffy lead disappeared unseen doorway followed dark passageway long flights steps
footsteps echoed no sound
passageway went long lightless slope ended heavy door
door opened smoothly company entered chamber
behind door clanged shut sound like deep metallic gong
pitch black see nothing
suddenly silence ping brilliant light illuminated strangest places
blinked harsh brightness looked around
big city gang still surrounded seemed relaxed
clearly arrived star chamber
room large circular brick lined chamber high domed roof
six doors around circumference chamber identical shut one entered didnt know one
large old wooden table number chairs no two alike standing threadbare circular rug
stately chandelier place palace hanging centre room
fixed old hook rusty iron chain
light device sparkled rebounded equally dramatic ceiling
ornate brightly painted scene clouds cherubs centre magnificent chasm surrounded trumpeting angels covered dome
whole effect dramatic unnerving
tuffy gang already seated waved seat amongst
looked around companions luxurious light able see first time
different chairs occupied
tuffy tall arrogant leader exuded calm control
street wise dress seemed faded magnificent chamber sat like king amongst knights
filled elegant cut glass goblets wine earthenware decanter handed around
received glass
muffy sat right hand leader
maintained constant sneer otherwise indistinct face
clothes mimicked tuffy failed ill fit muffys physical demeanour succeed exerting anything comical expression ineptitude
muffy none tuffys lean gaunt sharp style comfortable fireside physique little overweight little short stature little grey pallor ordinary youth
puffy occupied chair side tuffy
puffy huge girth perched rather sat chair wide fit
inconsiderable height seemed diminished weight
schoolboy face adorned pair broken horn rimmed spectacles
looked like giant baby pink fat constantly wiping drops perspiration away forehead
completely bald head often covered massive white stetson hat dominated whole appearance
put hat beside table
next chair contained huffy whose purpose seemed exaggerate size companion
huffy tiny like jockey
stood five feet tall bony sallow youth
clothes several sizes large
wore black suit tie pallid appearance undertakers assistant
sat hunched glass holding stem hands curled around like claws
scrawny neck emerged turtle like shiny jacket badly broken nose gave face beak like quality
vulturish creature scowled across table without blinking whilst constantly muttering oaths
duffy sat opposite leader
dressed like farm boy check shirt jeans
arms legs seemed proportion body reached awkwardly clothes
small eyes large mouth seemed permanently surprised
sat hands pockets chewed gum whilst pushing back chair onto spindly hind legs large limbs splayed front
noticed spoke no one frequently laughed making sound like braying donkey
last chair bar stool perched crystal
seemed quite place company yet also seemed occupy special position
first impression girl
wore black leather jacket loose jeans
sat legs apart elbows table toying small length knotted rope
dishevelled red hair hung limp strands across face
closer inspection possible view beneath tawny shadows see clear grey eyes smooth creamy freckled skin distinctive girls face
everyone received wine company stood raised goblets
tuffy sang big city gang reply came others big city gang
shout echoed domed roof rang around chamber like bell sounding
everyone sat except leader looked gleam eye
welcome star chamber harry
shouted everyone laughed
looked sheepishly reply

spun clamps held closed swung open

feel breeze blowing gap door opened sound water emerged darkness beyond
reminded cave sgurr cavan
careful inside slippery called sound falling water
go railing
went forward gingerly dark found smooth cold wet railing gripped
stood hesitantly crystal found light switch
dim light revealed underground river disappeared distance
flowed brick lined tunnel water tumbled weir feet hidden cavern
air heavy moisture walls green mossy looking growths algae
small landing stage one side large wooden canoe complete paddles tied railing
get shouted crystal

boarded small craft started journey river
first hard work paddling current made steady progress

silence moment crystal began sing
voice filled dark space slow haunting liquid clear beautiful sound
words song hovered dreamily air
magic journey changed life
waters run silent dark
deeper blackness falls time lost destiny invisible calls
freedom flows towards sea forever moving mountains far still call icy crown
tongues liquid moving thought like flames flicker tunnels meanings sought question true
listen filled hope fear pass night morning brings answer clear dawning new light
star chamber empty returned one one gang entered various doors surrounded
tuffy waited present set trot rest followed
middle group huffy ran close behind
journey surface brisk uneventful
gang moved quickly speak
ran collective rhythm moved like machine
even puffy fat one seemed propel along without effort
gang go onto street together slipped one one intervals several different exits
huffy suddenly took shoulder guided firmly side passage
wait whispered
waited silently went ahead opened door onto side street
light poured outside slipped
seconds later returned said follow
stepped together onto street blinked afternoon light
time underground world star chamber no reference without light heat sun easy forget rest world existed
outside quiet lazy saturday afternoon city
rain cleared away warm sun shone brightly
without gang around couple lads
street walked normally huffy started talk short disjointed sentences
come island said
never never want neither one day going leader see ship went last year still
flooded long time ago biggest port coast huffy went mechanical drone voice walked towards city centre
changed direction often avoid detection grey followers
still felt lost occasional glimpses buildings confirmed getting closer city centre
walk town took long time
much realised
appearance surrounding buildings changed moved
warehouse district gave way factory district factory district gave way shopping district
encountered hardly people walking shopping district found another world
never seen many people many shops
great car parks edge occupied rows rows shiny cars
whole thing resembled layer beehive cars buzzing manoeuvring constant motion
beyond car parks distance shopping halls glass marble palaces filled moving stairways lifts cascades plants waterfalls
plate glass windows dozens gift clothing shops ranged along walls halls
squares roofs held cafs restaurants shoppers sat idly chatting passing day
sugary music drifted air hubbub people sliding feet shiny marble floors
colours bright exciting displays full exotic

solitary horseman cantering across grass towards tree lined dell distance
huffy started walking across grass casual circuitous route followed
quarter hour later entered ring trees growing around lip former clay pit
saw horseman still mounted foot hill looking interest
huffy ran slope centre dell followed
approached realised horseman crystal
looked quite different saddle
seated proud mount thought looked heroic
shadows appeared around banks long entire big city gang standing together group
light fading evening shadows fallen across old clay pit leaving group well hidden

heard sound running water distance impression space wafted cool breeze
duffy shone small torch saw drain no water directly appeared entrance form underground tank
came long wait
started speak often
asked crystals horse raised head listening intently
shh whispered crystal slipped tree stump handing pegasus reins

never spoke anyone simply smiled looked
crystal pegasus reappeared quietly gone angry heard approaching
gently slowly came bank opposite direction

duffy untied bags hanging saddle horse tied length rope
together dropped rope bag bag edge manhole took strain six bulging pillowcases duffy tied rope top rung iron ladder descended darkness

crystals voice quiet firm
made mind mine
crystal seemed quiet contemplative progressed without word passing
felt enraptured wonder city night
lights thousands houses apartments concealed hundreds thousands lives moving together like myriad parts gigantic organism
distance see elevated freeway seemed lights cars pulsed along like lifeblood city roads like arteries
turned small road car turned behind
suddenly car raced past
feel horse tense beneath
whoa boy crystal leaned stroked beasts neck
car squealed stop ahead second car came slowly behind

crystal handed man packet whispered something pointing wound hind quarter
old man ran hands
turned without word still glancing unsympathetically towards
man led animal inside crystal turned towards pointed road follow
evening wearing still miles destination walked quickly
crystal seemed busy thoughts remained silent talk follower made wary looked shadows every junction
mile passed quiet lonely world shopping district night
contrast bright family filled shops day night time squalor startling
dark doorways home drunks dropouts runaways muttered oaths shrank back shadows passed
crystal ignored found repulsive filled danger
dirty men unintelligible slurs waved bottles asked money sinister silent black shapes stayed huddled beneath old coats dark squalid corners
people live
asked

walked trying look aside went
saw shadow emerge doorway ahead stand darkness
crystal must seen quickly crossed road moved hurriedly way

crystal walked briskly towards main square ahead light
glanced behind saw figure walking swiftly along opposite pavement
follower
whispered

well alone
stick close behind go exactly go replied breathlessly increased pace
minute later darted small passageway ramp empty car park
car park cavernous filled rows pillars walls ramps lift shafts
handful cars
dodged around different levels stealthily quietly crystal motioned stop
crouched beside parapet view entrance
presently dark shadow crossed threshold entered building

crystal pushed back hair first time minutes really see face
eyes shining damp
perhaps little slow little dense sometimes
perhaps experience new
stood stupidly blinking floor
crystal reached hand put shoulder
stood looking straight downcast eyes
help look meet questioning eyes
moment no choice knew won
nodded assent
beaming smile face total amazement hugged walked elated twisting passages
began recognise places passed earlier day time reached heavy bulkhead door realised crystal meant escape along old underground river
opened door went
saw water canoe left
heaved heavy door shut turned bolt
pitch black within sound water loud close deep dark surrounding
well right canoe must without lights said crystal
tuffy turns bed time
added
still carrying duffel bag left fear losing triumphantly pulled small torch one taken sgurr cavan
even torch getting canoe performance
soon ready cast
new adventure begun
river flowed made steady slow progress upstream
used torch sparingly show way ahead
hard keep scraping slimy walls
travelling city uncharted waters ancient secret river
went darkness towards freedom
splash paddles echoed roof
water flowed almost silently slender craft moved
passed unseen openings felt darkness
streams entered weirs poured water unknown places
must hundreds tunnels drains
evidence around showed craftsmen built
millions bricks lined tunnels arches
twice glimpsed light street lights shone cracks distant drain high river secret world
belonged night
must follow river right across city marsh
stick take way home
way small job
crystal sounded little different new assertiveness tone
leader gang
several hours passed felt tired
sound water rhythm paddling lulling dreamy wakefulness
suddenly crystal lifted paddle aboard pulled canoe small landing stage
shine torch said excited voice
pointed beam towards slanting shaft dropped darkness within see quite clearly form six white pillowcases tied rope hanging rusty ladder
chapter seven secret river scrambled sloping culvert
pillowcases hanging dark
old iron ladder broken sufficient remained provide footrest
last cases dangled almost reach stretch void grab rope untie end
gripped pillowcase began clamber cotton snagged broken railing whole parcel money fell hand slithered dark
look shouted followed back canoe
time reached bottom crystal sitting cross legged canoe grimy wet pillowcase front
sorry
said sat
crystal laughed echoes rebounded choruses happiness
others
asked
take fair share replied
trust respect thats works
extracted bags money stowed haul dry sack front boat set dark
moneys stolen police find
asked
heard tuffy
gambling bad habit
saving people
case money
make money
make rules
dont play game
anyway money isnt
hands toiled build canal forgotten felt knew work
thought must dignified purposeful people
travelling tunnel strange experience
escaping yet tunnel held captive within dark subterranean universe
black brick lined tube seemed endless remote living world
loss sight enhanced senses became breeze detectives
temperature smell feeling filled thoughts
despite sounds around completely quiet place ever known
peaceful reverence pervaded tunnel demanded respectful silence
learned see worms eye view ever distance held image pinprick light yet unseen marked entrance real world lay beyond
tunnel continued many miles
paddled regular pace deep night resting occasionally journey city long arduous
long day felt sleepy
although want stop felt sure safe free tiredness overcame
found railing far beyond drain park secure canoe slept
canoe good accommodation two sleep
wide enough sleep side side short end end
covered best possible jackets laid heads sack money centre canoe
good night harry yawned crystal thanks
slept fitfully uncomfortably curled bottom boat
water dripped constantly roof around thankfully little landed
absolute darkness unnerving found impossible measure passage time endless deep night tunnel
woke cold hungry sunday lightless dawn false morning
crystal planned escape well rations rat proof tin hidden bow
meagre snack set moving darkness subterranean day
back ached hard night canoe good going
tunnel turned series wide curves first one way another
many passages leading main channel moved constant fear losing way swept weir
slow going guess right way
twice back dead ends
day hardly spoke never felt need
often crystal start hum paddled along
started sing immediately stopped
go said love hear sing
no no yet
wont sing safe free
paddled silence
early evening finally approached tunnel entrance
last hundred yards tunnel numerous junctions main channel sub divided two equal parts
consulting compass chose left route continued way
disturbingly tunnel seemed getting smaller duck avoid hitting heads
smell change air
something free infiltrating close confines hint freshness darkness
ever lowering roof disquieting emerged final bend saw light distance
last rosy flare sunset reflected water creeping hazy evening air
thought tiredness dropped away cramped limbs paddled renewed vigour
felt new excitement thrill piloted canoe swiftly along
pinpoint quickly grew inverted horseshoe shaped opening
air gloom became fresher still distant sounds penetrated tunnel
bright dynamics natural world released blinkered stifled senses
small craft came rest heavy rusty iron grating lay like portcullis across entrance
peered bars imprisoned heart sank

asked
dont worry way crystal replied
lets see see first
vast empty mistiness outside covered marsh
filled air far see
watched evening sun dipped horizon far right clouds looked like mountains
no sign human habitation ample wildlife raucous calls ducks geese great billowing clouds gnats mosquitoes occasional plop rat entering water filled air ahead
night descended quickly across marshes darkness
sleep said crystal
least safe place stay tonight
see safe perhaps safe
break barrier ahead
tired tied canoe inside grating
lay best beneath coats cool dark
sleep soon overcame discomfort big city filled dreams
awoke start
looked nervously around expected see familiar surroundings bedroom

slowly recalled previous night disturbingly canoe no longer tunnel entrance crystal nowhere
alone
first thought shes abandoned
shes left
felt slight panic thought hit
settled
no done

used dark days perpetual night make outline tunnel tell kind junction several tunnels leading different directions
felt torch gone
crystal must taken
settled wait
little else
trust said
time trust
hear strange noise distance coming nearer
sounded like high pitched wind whatever heading towards
suddenly black shadow shot overhead another another
dropped floor canoe
rushing noise turned squealing screech hoards bats flew overhead
air thick creatures
flew inches head filled whole tunnel
must thousands tiny mammals
air solid black
noise deafening
animals started landing crouched canoe
feel hair
enveloped hundreds tiny bats flapping squealing
tried beat crawling arms face biting hands
claws razor sharp hands scalp
hard breathe air stank
came crowded around
many tiny talons cheeks
dared open eyes
open mouth shout help
panic moment something
tried stand mass bats made impossible
thing think tumbled canoe river submerged completely
bats dropped mad confusion
stayed long hold breath emerged gasping
horror immediately attacked
ducking waded half waddling tunnel
every seconds put head breath
time still bats fewer fewer
stood walked half running tunnel turning twisting dozen junctions surrounded silence
stood dripping inky black
bats gone completely lost
found edge tunnel slimy weed slowly made way back first junction
discern least three ways
crystal crystal
said loud
sounded loud voice turned whisper fear overtook
stood silently
completely dark feel water moving past legs
course course
follow flow
started walking every junction stopped still feel water flowing past
minutes later came large tunnel junction
sure back main tunnel
followed walls came ledge suddenly cracked shins canoe
dim light seen reflecting water far distance
suddenly blotted
involuntarily tensed expectation
no noise followed
moved dry things canoe way climbed dripping onto thwart
long passageway beside leading tangent main channel still wide enough take canoe
ready loosen painter paddle round sight
minute later soothed stiff limbs saw shadowy shape crystal wading water towards
getting closer turned torch
carried trousers draped shoulder
chrissy whispered
welcoming smile dropped saw

perimeter big city airport lay sight man made plateau
terminal already coming noisily life mile behind

crystal stood water watching waiting
slowly crouched close bank stayed motionless bare legged statue
concentration task seemed total
looked fascinated entranced
communion nature
moment discovery
strange girl selfless nave yet full knowledge experience
moment felt warmth inside known
knew friend new friend seemed almost dreamlike alone magical girl
fish moved shadows river bank hung current drifting crystals shadow

gently crystal stroked bodies two large trout sheltered shade
smallest rhythmical movements seemed entrance fish submission
completely involved task
suddenly without warning
caught two trout landed bank
gleaming silvery fish stunned gunwale crystal took knife headed towards tunnel
using brick wall workbench gutted beheaded fish

tied canoe orders crystal went back find sufficient dry material small fire
used knife good effect returned tunnel armful reeds rushes together two pieces driftwood found caught riverbank
crystal pulled tin bottom canoe made fire ledge
matches thankfully pocket went water
still within sight entrance two tunnels branched
flickering light spread ghastly shadows across old brickwork fire smoked somewhat
fish skewered two sticks held flames
pleased warmth wet clothes
quickly doused flames fish cooked
sat edge tunnel eat meal
food rudimentary satisfying
tunnel flues drawn smoke darkness hoped disperse emerged
returned canoe daylight cautiously started walk river
crystal front turned gave odd look laughed
silly harry
said still looking cant walk river like
youll need dry clothes sleep tonight
feel blushing
dreading moment
right smiled
ill look way
knew right
wrung sodden socks trousers draped canoe dry sun
felt like began enjoy adventure
grey smoky pall hung big city behind
mixture mist pollution made peculiar atmosphere seemed somehow apt
felt secure marsh practically invisible vastness surroundings
no roads near place luck long passage secret river tunnel deadened scent followers might attempted find
late summer sun kept warm watery surroundings
clothes soon dried made reasonable progress
even seen no reason attract special attention
edge airport soon became noisy blot amongst general haze behind
ahead air cleared midday see across far side marsh distance beyond
firm banks stream receded back high reed beds surrounded either side making progress invisible except air
water level small private world
stream walking along seemed keep less course far side marsh albeit straight path
fortunately crystal seemed element among reed beds walked ahead reading way precision
side stream joined main river heard crystal sigh stood looked scene
water channel seemed half empty
able row canoe
damn dam hissed
progressed along old river narrower channel snaking old broad river bed became
gradual change took place surroundings reeds either side gave way tussocky humps protruded boggy brown peat
cotton grass waved white fluffy heads waters edge occasional half fallen alder trees attempted grow stonier places
river widened little marsh gave way firmer ground water channelled rivulets low banks
way led sparse woodland crack willows
stood twisted gnarled ancient half leaning half fallen swamp
stopped shade
evening approaching water becoming cold bare legs walk river much longer
tied canoe made camp night firm ground among trees
ducks eggs sorrel leaves crystal collected earlier day extended fishy diet
cook meal evening mist started descend hide smoke fire
ate glorious sunset flooded misty skies crimson gold
looked quietly talked

took white crystal pocket lay concealed small leather pouch unwrapped
almost dark brilliant stone reflected glimmer light shone
crystal caught breath stared precious stone
slowly opened box unwrapped item inside
placed hand beside mine second crystal glowed two stars deepening mists
looked long time growing dark
suddenly thought

stones lay hand

magic said meeting coming going going
no chance million years brought together white crystals
dont need think
perhaps said crystal dreamily

think sleep
tired dark theres still long way go tomorrow
tuesday morning journey continued marshes
becoming weary watery wilderness surrounded
needed shelter good food
found difficult walk soft ground muddy streambeds felt tired
water channels grew smaller often heave canoe reeds banks coarse grass
air marshes humming insects constantly surrounded got hair mouth eyes
think well call place midge marsh joked crystal waved hand clouds insects surrounded
swarms mosquitoes left sore itching
dank pools water bubbled either side fresh water streams foul marsh gas filled air loathsome stench
one point stumbled nest water snakes
sinister creatures slid directions jumped canoe safety
kept wary eye open marsh creatures ventured forth
dont like much admitted
something makes uneasy
cant feel
yes
something ahead
think theres something waiting
dont know
heading towards way go
sooner reach woods better replied
take cover
tuesday night slept canoe last time
safety moored centre small river broadened substantial pond barrier silt
air much colder previous nights managed well enough
become used hard cramped sleeping quarters slept well
awoke early wednesday morning sound sensation falling rain
feet canoe heron stood one foot water quizzical expression face
great bird flapped wings awkwardly slowly ascended fly away south
damp cold decided proceed without breakfast find shelter
days journey began
paddled edge pond walked relative cover sometimes difficult terrain sparse woodland
began see sandstone shale banks either side lay miniature cliffs terraces rose firmer ground
twice glimpsed iridescent flash kingfisher flying hole bank
midday woodland closed forest oak beech marshland behind
river spread shallow stony brook inches deep time come let canoe go
carried deep pool beneath small waterfall filled stones water sank
sad leave behind good home
gathering packs walked woods top small rocky hill view land
fortunately rain stopped air clear
surprised no longer see big city distance behind
even marsh beyond woodland indistinct
knew encounter signs human habitation somewhere ahead planned buy wholesome food soon
well trodden path hill led towards road meant must village town somewhere distance
passed time walking along path telling crystal something legend mythras include story crystal journey across water
eventually saw roofs distance
struck across heathland towards settlement
finally walked main square small town late afternoon
tired hungry
place small attractive market town ideal purpose
appeared holiday destination big city folk sightseers walking
already decided pose hikers holiday need arose
bought map snacks small shop found quiet place rest eat
money pillowcase much expected crystal intend use ill gotten windfall journey
said dangerous
instead small sum used buy food
went camping shop used last crystals money buy tiny inconspicuous tent
set find shelter night
decided woodland best place stay located forest area map
hill miles town appeared provide perfect cover
carrying heavy loads slowed passage eating wholesome meal improved spirits renewed strength
evening beautiful happy take time reach destination
came steep valley deep woods grove ancient yew trees
quiet even sullen
no bird song place silence complete intimidating made whisper
dark vale ordinarily inviting fulfilled wish quiet undisturbed halt night
presence almost invisible even within coomb
bottom wood small clearing made camp beside stream
decided light fires already eaten go directly sleep rise first light morning get long days travelling belts refreshed
inside tent shut mournful gloom silent valley long fell restless sleep
several times awoke sound animals moving outside
heard rustling leaves quiet snuffling sounds creatures night searched food
sombre quiet even clicking beetles undergrowth seemed loud
felt tense lay listening night
deep black darkness dense felt crushing
somehow sinister tunnels
drifted back uneasy sleep
crystal woke early hours awakened
yet light something manner seemed agitated urgency voice
dont like place whispered
lets go
dont like either
replied
eerie
silently gathered belongings
use torch
suddenly distance heard strange noise
stopped stock still waited silence
animal maybe
chilled
lets leave tent
well collect later
whispered
slid dark crystal handed bags
cautiously crept behind nearby bush
air tense still though storm might approaching
crystal followed flitted bush bush tree tree back head small coomb
dark valley see anything along ridge hill night sky showed lighter grey behind silhouettes trees
crouched still looked around several slow silent minutes
feeling unease persisted felt better open surprised
strange sound came something like howl vixen closer time
suddenly saw two strange shadows top hill
stood quite still
seemed sniffing air
nearly stopped breathing
stood hundred yards away looking valley
moved disappeared
almost panicked stood ground
hear faint movement dark went quiet moment
second later distant metallic scratching sound followed quickly blaze fire
set tent alight valley filled furious brief inferno
watched two daemonic figures dancing round blazing tent
flames spread ghoulish shadows trees strange animal cries echoed woods triumphant loud
ghastly enchanting
crystal tugged hand ran fast away terror
bounded undergrowth dragging packs along
twigs snapped brambles scratched faces hands still kept running
saw pale light clearing ahead stopped still standing heaving breath pounding hearts
forest road front bounded high laurel hedge
behind silent
crawled hedge hidden
lets wait til daybreak whispered hoarsely
took crystals hand felt hot trembling
pulled gently ground sat back back inside hedge waited waited
time passed slowly
saw no one except shadows trees heard nothing wind branches
dawn showed grey sky frightening events night seemed fade away dreams
cant stay longer freezing
lets go said crystal suddenly
okay
well safe getting light
small confidence returned sun stood stepped onto dirt road continue journey
immediately walked sudden noise behind awful call strange men
saw edge woodland track
started run towards ran no use
harry
theyre going catch cried crystal
well fight shouted back
make stand
stopped turned stood together panting
felt crystals hand
around fifty yards away
dropped packs faced raced towards
wore tattered black robes carried long poles
deep hoods shaded faces
stood gripping others hand
wait til get close say run round one side
said trembling voice
twenty feet go opened mouth shout
suddenly stopped
absolute silence
stood shivering fear resolute stood yards away poles raised strike
feel tears terror rising eyes
crystals hand gripped mine resolutely
silence heard blood pumping head
something changed turned quickly fled back road like pair frightened dogs
looked confused wondering
spontaneously hugged relief dare turn away
crystal
thought going die
worse replied
go
dont know lets get return
picked packs turned walk stopped still stood
path fifty paces behind stood two large horses surmounted two riders looked sternly
finely dressed horsemen wore uniforms gold deep green
chestnut horses wore silken gold green cloths beneath saddles
cloths bore symbol double cross

whispered
good bad
look double cross crystal whispered back
riders approached slowly
gold horseman spoke clearly deep steady voice found time

asked shakily
lords double cross spoke emerald lord interest prize carry
safe said companion gold lord
follow place unwanted friends return
saying turned horse walked slowly away
crystal looked
seem know lot whispered
well go replied resignedly
least look civilised somewhat time
feel like ive walked medieval dream
emerald lord dismounted signalled walk ahead
bade crystal ride saddle took reins lead great horse
know handle even great horse think
little alternative requested strange folk
terror night still fresh mind seemed least safe passage away unknown aggressors
size strength horses bearing men bred confidence security
also fascination
people
know
significance double cross
take
questions filled mind minutes met horsemen
small band forest track seemed mysteriously ancient
silence woods removed thoughts modern life mind
noble horses finely dressed lords walking together along mossy way surrounded dripping misty trees like picture romantic childhood story
fluting lazy late summer song birds combined earthy smell approaching autumn air lead dream like unreality
accepted new companions saviours knew
strange feeling larger play enacted part
yet also become aware step new history also linked magic mythras white crystal
seemed travelling backward time old different future
looked passing trees almost seemed watching
emerald lord caught eye began recite poem
deep bass voice reassuring words beautiful
forest reach fine tree hold eye
dark free pine tree sharp silhouette sky
wind plays breezes branches sun ignites colours fiery glances
luxuries beech woods fill earth sky
like chameleons seasons fables filled reasons truth never lie
winter freezes cold ghostly skeletons haunt forest floor
despite death exterior hearts warm life suspended core voices whisper sleeping dreams time barely creeping
late summer morning see leaves making patterns mind ecstasy movement shivering pictures liquid beauty shattered mirrors sharpened splinters like icicles forgotten winters warmly dancing sky
come reach fine tree natures glory eye
love words see love words also said emerald lord fell silent
true something poem filled new hope
good man true hold things sacred
party moved ahead steadily quietly accompanied soft footfall horses hooves leaf mould forest sounds bird wind stream
path took upwards towards hilly crown woods
reverie walked contentedly
seemed reality become dream
within felt men trusted least
crystal spoke
going
safe place
must know inadvertently put danger
found must followed
seen follower
asked gold lord
two followers
asked
no replied emerald lord dangerous little local villains
follower forward ways
yes replied
seen shadow follower
since left big city
good said emerald lord
think left ancient way even unaware
must trust ask
know trust
asked crystal
gold lord drew horse back alongside scrutinised face
said know someone trust
heard crystal draw breath
gold lord continued know trust
trust gained short
travelled many miles find companion bring safety
admit looking two
perhaps rather case whether trust
expect trust actions words endeavour show honest open true
need must judge may help
travellers journey foolish young brave offer safe passage dangerous land
give trust say wish go alone much grieve may
understand obliged oath protect still distance past days watching
horseman looked towards summit approaching spoke
also another matter
one wishes speak companion

enquired simply
may feel know already
name wolfe
shrugged
dont know name
heard called names mythras
magician
cried
no one may mind
name mythras title
speak place may safe
unwelcome companions know assume follower also knows
saying gold lord rode ahead party climbed final slope clearing top forest
outcrop rock prevented trees taking purchase
windy place commanded view around compass sea distance behind mountains ahead
much closer towered horizon
great slopes rose rank upon rank wooded foothills bare escarpments beyond snow covered peaks lay glistening sun
looking traced whole journey distant grey smudge big city shimmering flat marshes across low level woods past town forest
gazed distant light sea find island home lost view
wondered ever return
stop breakfast said emerald lord unpacked saddlebag containing food drink
travelled well much journey complete
cold wind sweeping across hills distant mountains eating returned gratefully shelter trees
travelled seldom used paths horses picked way carefully stones undergrowth
day passed quietly journeyed deep thought
gold lord rarely spoke passed time silence
emerald lord seemed freer mind talked pointing features place
lull began chant ballad great length beauty
seemed old tune strange yet familiar
rhythm fitted easy pace horses
recall verses
tale minstrel sailed across sea met princess although fell love part go separate ways
strangeness circumstance walk beautiful
forest extensive vista vista opened ridge climbed slowly towards towering hills
people met shepherds passed lead sheep goats winter grazing
two lords always make way shepherds turn bid good day
struck two lords appear strangers people
shepherds give crystal straight long stare passed made no comment
eventually came long wall climbed hills sight
seemed incongruous travelling many miles without sign mans endeavours
party followed wall around track way gate
standing gate old man dressed white
came forward speak gold lord
welcome friend said firm voice great horseman dismounted
two men shook hands flicker smile crossed faces
wolfe said gold lord
old man turned spoke welcome erebos waited long meet

minutes later entered great chamber intense heat molten rock glowed within engulfed
ruddy light reflected face old man glinted skin hair

suddenly thought struck maybe answer right front eyes
crossed room large ornate fireplace peered behind screen
indeed large flue although climb whether able escape top determine
took pillowcase made balaclava hat protect face eyes
found drawer pair leather gloves protect hands
still wearing fine clothes crawled claustrophobic fireplace tried climb
first attempt failed grip sides flue feet
removed shoes socks slung laces belt tried
able grip courses bricks fingers toes wedging back side flue slowly scrape way skyward
chimney filthy pungent smell soot damp filled nostrils makeshift hat effective keeping worst face
flue became narrower towards top managed push way
knew one false move crash bottom lost
limbs ached trembled exertion climb struggled find toehold support top
chimney no pot gaping square brick stack slanted holes made side draught
dislodged loose bricks one side pushed hole
time strain limbs support weight pressing back stack becoming painful desperate
bricks fell rumbling crash froze loud report no sounds followed continued enlarge hole reach carefully let bricks
eventually big enough crawl
looked edge semi dark saw large flat lead covered roof perhaps twenty similar stacks emerging
sighed relief good fortune finding flat roof
took last strength crawl hole tumble outside
lay still minute unable move aching legs enough raise

noticed changed back old clothes
reassuring real crystal back
tiptoed back room make escape
wedged door shut stood moment silence listening following footsteps heard none
crystal silently laughed saw light
soot dirt covered clothes still pillowcase head
brushed washed hands quickly grabbing packs joining crystal sitting room
clock showing quarter midnight fifteen minutes less wolfe discover missing
unlike mine bedroom small stone balcony tied rope knotted earlier balustrade
crystal went first disappearing darkness
see rope went slack jerked twice
pulled rope tied backpacks
lowered one time
seemed take forever tie untie knots
kept looking behind door
suppose wolfe early
last ready climb
hands feet already sore blistered climbing chimney rope little thin cut painfully skin
dropped last four feet land beside friend
way freedom five midnight
sat slipped socks shoes gathered packs
raw hands swollen feet slowed progress
finally ready
somewhere inside great house clock began strike midnight
happened next terrified shock surprise
ear splitting crack
dropped ground
followed deep thunderous rumble somewhere far
felt ground move beneath jumped pulled crystal away house
earth shivering violently balustrade crashed ground crushing rope beneath spot crouching
frightening silence filled air
tremor passed
earth held breath
stood momentarily stunned fixed spot
crystal grabbed hand dragged away place
way lets go called hoarsely
turned ran fast across lawns wall
heart pounded panic
behind house came sound shouting commotion
scrambled wall ran woods behind house towards path led mountains
somewhere ahead heard wolf cry night
harry descending rope balustrade ground wolfe deep beneath house old mines checking preparations
old man planned leave house night knew probably return
threw last boxes papers books smouldering cauldron molten rock
fires erebos consumed many volumes studies night
wolfe no longer needed
white crystal almost possession receive knowledge seeking life
thought able move different time infiltrate place history unseen unknown welcome unwelcome
planned influence world shaman become mystery force no one stop
wolfe understood magic stone eager possess
wolfe knew harry white crystal guessed kept
first thought take force
gold lord suspicious
careful
must no trace
bottle camphor ready silence boy room
old magician take stone bring boy molten pit
knew needed spell magic words lost
crystal boy possessed
take long get spoken spell harry tonight
no one defy terror hung pulpit appalling molten lake long
wanted let boy drop lava consumed no trace left
wolfe use crystal leave erebos
dawn already many miles away unseen maybe years away
intended go council elders secretly discover source power
infiltrate chambers power wherever found
wolfe become sicarius mythras last
trembled excitement thought future
old live forever
task completed wolfe ascended house went harrys room
key hand ready unlock door
turning twelve oclock stood outside room moment hesitated
great tower clock struck first chime midnight cracking sound loud thunderbolt filled air
came beneath house
part plan
heart stopped second turned ran stairs towards mines
left doors open take boy
must closed
ground beneath began shiver ran tunnel
door behind crashed shut
roaring like thunder echoed along corridors sound hurt ears
walls moved rocks cracked jagged lines head
turned ran back door move
no escape
glowing mass choking sulphurous smoke billowed along tunnel towards wolfe cowered corner
held breath closed eyes long
opened eyes smoke risen vibration stopped
erebos silent breathed relief
still shaking tried door held fast
harry crystal moment escaping mountains wolfe prisoner mines erebos
workings abandoned many centuries lava flow broken tunnels slowly claiming another victim
pressure building silent mines
already magma pool nearly filled huge chamber
glowing molten rock crept along slowly climbing spiral passage pushed inexorably forward unstoppable pressure beneath earths crust
walls tunnel around began glow dull red fearful heat
wolfe stood waited awful ruddy light
rocks around grinding rasping pressure built
rock cracked crumbled walls ceiling
wolfe faced final avenger madness filled mind screamed terror
turned scratch heavy steel door sealed broken
suddenly lights went split glowing dark huge roar anger
tra
turned face oncoming doom dropped knees
spoke quiet voice last words world no one hear
forgive harry mad
destruction
looking proud face looked world weary aged face man resigned death
gentle face sad face perhaps found truth last
meanwhile tremor lords double cross assembled drawing room
searched house found wolfe harry crystal disappeared
gold lord looked shaken spoke
believe wolfe turned evil
seen earlier
may already failed
everyone search property guests
fear lives
find wolfe spare mad voice rasped spoke
young ones
asked emerald lord
fear taken
may dead already maybe worse grimaced
began search suspicions heightened found wolfe removed many precious books belongings
none suspected truth none knew disused mines house
gold lord despatched two messengers warn council elders
remainder party found no clues searched house grounds
two tremors night neither animals servants stay near place longer
decided shut house go heartland safer ground
morning come lords double cross left never return erebos lay deserted desolate corrie mountains
crystal climbed steadily night high hills old house find old paths seen marked maps
night strangely quiet
animals terrified earthquake fled
tremor also scared little else except continue walk
moon shone lit scene cold pale light revealed every tree rock sharp sinister silhouettes
two wary travellers kept cover much able
every sound seemed loud silence night second distant wolf like cry made freeze tracks
sound subsided echoes valleys erebos continued haste
many hours walking found shepherds hut hillside
pushed open door entered place rest
exhausted
slept feet door heads packs
dawn broke mountains awoke crystal old tumbledown shelter
ate sparingly knowing long supplies might need last
cautiously opened door went cool morning light
mountains towered majestically
detect black form large bird circling early thermal high soft blue sky
perhaps half dozen smaller birds gulls chasing dipping diving calling fear agitation great bird
eagle floated serene unfettered protestations beneath
watching eagles slow deliberate movements early air filled hope
dropped suddenly distant remote cliff face close mountain top
behind crystal stopped still behind placed hand shoulder
thank said quietly knew troubles shared
stood silence alone thoughts together
valley far make distant form erebos empty windows glinting sun
turned back evil place began walk old sheep track
path crossed bridge stream continued head valley crystal hoped find road eventually take towards fathers farm
walked along path beside stream
water little trickle stream bed deep wide channel fit mountain river water eroded rock centuries
crystal looked small stream despair appeared determined step forward upward
hands clenched fists stride became sure firm
noticed seemed looking something ahead
crystal
asked
youll see
youll see soon enough replied fists clenched even tighter
climbed wooded valley beside stream bed
dense foliage enclosed slopes valley head see open sky
clambered final steep slope onto exposed rocky ridge
air cold clear
ascended hundreds feet mountains
crystal climbed last feet ridge stopped short looked straight ahead
heard draw breath hiss like angry snake
suddenly saw
object crystals hate dam loomed
stood like fortress wall across valley
emerging base massive silver pipeline snaked valley distance
pipeline drained life fathers farm many others
water company never planned compensation reservoir people lived heartland
thats whispered looked awe smooth wall ahead
know intended reached dam
crystal wanted see monstrous construction understand enemy
imagined somehow stopping water pipeline act sabotage knew deep within hopeless foolish try anything
also knew need bare hands destroy mighty barrier
clambered steep slope onto broad new road switch backed way dam
road seemed incongruous remote area
stepped boldly along deserted carriageway reached dam mile long walk
construction massive
main wall dam buttressed sloping pillars wide coping overhung valley
road ran across top wall broad black
high parapet wall railings either side
looked across roadway saw arid mountainside dropped great lake curved away distance peaks rose either side
tower stone emerged like strange concrete island centre lake
wind swept across expanse water funnelled valley sides moaned despairingly railings
no one seen
crystal climbed onto wall beside road looked
view immense magnificent
high vantage point dam showed whole country laid like relief map
despite crystal wondered edifice size might
dam held waters check serene calm place beautiful
looked across scene noticed movement almost imperceptible ground far
relief map seemed changing minutely
ground direction erebos moving
lasted seconds moments later rumbling noise spread valleys towards
sound grew tearing crackling blast echoed round mountains engulfed fear
another tremor shouted
dont think stay
run
pulled crystals arm stood motionless wall
stared stupefied across valley
turned grabbed packs jumped road
ran back edge dam
distance heard another rumbling crack
long way scared nevertheless
beside dam small level plateau directly higher rocks
scrambled way top stood waiting listening
silence deathly silence experienced night
birds skimming lake arrived disappeared
no sign animal life anywhere
think
crystal asked trembling voice
stay replied firmly
stood watching distance see no movement heard no sound
looked mountains behind lake saw looked like smoke billowing side
avalanche
beneath began feel pulsing vibration
moments world went mad everything meant life seemed falter
ground solid inanimate became living breathing monster
rocks rippled like sail wind
lay vision became blurred
dust clouds peeled away lakeside
water lake began heave giant circular patterns formed across surface
great wave rushed broke across dam
loose boulders toppled high places crashed depths
quake passed became still still
attempted stand fell back dizzy nauseous
crystal stood slowly shaking involuntarily helped
held support walked crab like closer edge look valley
clouds dust settled water became still
everything continued though nothing occurred
saw something pointed ground front dam
wall see earth begin change colour slowly first darkened stained
ruddy earth seemed bleeding
silently slowly water lake began turn dip
time water level old streambed began rise new cascade flowed old courses
visible hole appeared like small dark tunnel concrete wall base dam
pieces concrete began break away crashed hillside
looked tiny height big enough smash old bridge tumbled crack appeared wall dam another another
hear water started gain momentum thunder break
torrent became wave washing hillside hour toiled upwards
water level lake seemed changed
dam great water greater slowly spinning whirlpool appeared
revolving mass liquid moved ever faster watching made dizzy
vortex deepened strange whistling noise filled air growing ever louder screeched fury
water appeared cracks dam began spray showers turned vast silken rainbows sun
terrible beauty scene stunning
seconds later hole became breach complete section dam wall collapsed mass flying rubble
tidal wave water washed hillside lake taken many months fill finally emptied across world violent seconds carving muddy scar went
carried everything path
small forest valley became raging green sea reappeared muddy log jam
tangled jagged remains pipeline bucked writhed like dancing snake settled lay broken hollow empty amongst debris
tide rolled towards erebos
crystal find no words say
stood silence
devastation complete
something ended crystal began weep
dont upset said quietly

crystal crying tears joy
water swept away bad return home renewed
knew part story almost
dried eyes turned
must go harry whispered hoarsely go home must go home
crystal gave friendly hug turned walk across hills hand hand
began journey heartland
two companions
somehow knew no longer felt danger
hearts felt light exhilaration filled veins sang walking song known years
crystal joined paced dusty crumpled road away disaster
unknown two home bound travellers wave water destroyed dam pipeline
far forest follower watching waiting
seen wall water heard avoid
no living thing survived overwhelming wave
away still waters lake poured great fissure opened earthquake
freshwater tide flooded tunnels erebos
house collapsed old mines noxious fiery destruction lay crushed ruined boiling pools lava erupted gaping wounds earth
water flooded across whole red smoking furnace quenched turbulent molten rock mass steaming ferment
boiling lake formed house slowly cooled
lava flows filled old tunnels secret erebos lost forever
beyond valleys highland across dusty arid plains sad farmer wife sat old farm pond dry
lady crying tears dry
man looked old slouched weary worry
river run close disappeared
two worn suitcases beside couple yard rusty car ready go
early autumn sun hazy incessant buzzing insects
man slowly raised head
shook though dispelling wrong thought
moment later leapt ran river bank
man began dance years dropped away
foul ditch sand growing damp
tiny trickle clear liquid snaked oozed miniature pool began fill
suddenly seemingly nowhere bird alighted stream began drink
man looked sky began laugh loud free victorious laugh
ran sad sombre lady took arms kissed cheek
love dearest love cant believe true
come let show come tell true led gently stream almost running
looked ditch began cry time tears streamed cheeks
hands clutched released air bent knelt beside dusty bank
scooped palm full miraculous water put lips kiss joy
crystal walked across snowy mountains three long days nights
travelled many miles along paths foothills heartland
disaster befallen place became clear found way old farmsteads crossed blasted plains
trees skeletal fields resembled desert
rains arrived aggravated pain
early equinoctial autumn storms washed away topsoil silt blocked ditches
rainwater soaked straight parched brown earth run brackish ponds no good
travelled towards crystals home desolate scenery became
farms empty many begun slow disintegration ruins
knew river already renewing land distance behind slowly filling reclaiming country relied upon life
water soon begin heal scars bring new spring
road river met old brick bridge spanned waters
always meeting place travellers ruins old inn stood gaunt silhouette roadside
place marked head ancient canal
dilapidated wharves workshops stood beside river
rusty relics sluices small crane stood abandoned quay
river canalised centuries earlier
days cars lorries canal carried farmers produce stream heart big city
late tuesday morning stopped bridge rest beneath warm autumn sun
time arrived new waters begun fill old courses
clean streams already started carry away green dank slime clear foul smelling air
new fresh perfume damp earth caressed senses place old evil
waters take long time soothe wounds land convalescence begun
stood watched solitary swan glided empty sky landed smooth waters bridge
crystal laughed loud joy
horse rider approached moving cloud dust along empty road ahead
rode steadily towards horse suddenly stopped looked ahead whinnied loudly cantering onto bridge
dust cloud settled reveal form emerald lord
looked tired worn brow furrowed finery soiled
horse whinnied shifted excitement
first emerald lord seemed unclear stooped passed hand across eyes
looked across gap dismounted strode towards
snorting steaming horse came straight across crystal pressed towards held proud head
go
go drink whispered ear horse obediently went drink waters edge emerald lord approached
looked like man shock
came silently forward touched believe real
believe survive
live favoured lives

emerald lord put hands clasped genuine warmth
taken aback

stood back looked
weary face taken new life broad smile
well done done well said

added crystal sharply
none things replied emerald lord laughing

yes trust replied
even though know

home lies across plain
hoped voice trailed away
turned away went horse took reins hand
crystal patted beast animal followed obediently across bridge
coming level mounted neptune
strapped packs onto saddle bag
tears eyes
parting friends always sad know lay ahead ever meet
good bye crystal said looking
shall dream tonight remember tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow
may changed world changed world
took hand moment stepped back
turned horse began walk away
reached end bridge turned towards
harry asked sing couldnt
well time come
remember like
crystal sat horse sang barely see watery eyes
water filled dry ditches tears filled eyes sky dry dusty made cloudy cries
new beginnings old friends parting many ways yet love friendship never ends memories fill days
long silence broken gentle sound water running sluice
turned horse walked slowly along track across dusty plain
watched faded distance gone sight
saw emerald lord watched also seemed sad
chapter nine going home emerald lord turned smiled
harry said need travel one time
going home
looked surprise
thought coming
questioned
yes thats right going home reaffirmed
journeys adventures befallen almost put home thoughts
course knew return begin imagine become arrived
still far away
dont live suidhe
asked
no replied
sometimes feel
see grandfather visitor time
suidhe kept diaries journal
boy told tales place many years later returned mainland gave books read
always intended return suidhe
used say unfinished business even claimed left belongings safe keeping
sadly never go back
eventually became ill knew never return promised one day go place
stories told left many impressions island wanted go see really like
world strange coincidences seemed stranger kept caution turned back river
get
asked
think route clear means travel already
saying stepped river bank looked along old canal
way may free suit
remember wharves thriving many craft came
perhaps return one day
led way across road series long abandoned sheds
opened half broken doors first shed
dusty dark inside cobwebs festooned ceilings dirt covered floor
perhaps twenty large canoes stacked racks either side shed
appeared unkempt serviceable
chose one seemed newer took sunlight
minutes spent cleaning revealed old solid craft
second shed revealed selection paddles chandlery
collected things thought useful ropes canvas covers holdalls fishing net many small sundries
canoe soon kitted checked lift
placed vessel water loaded provisions
must name boat
said
lets call crystal
replied emerald lord smiling
canoe large open traditional type accommodate two paddlers baggage ease
placed duffel bag thwart
companion brought spare saddlebag stowed stern
boarded vessel set towards city
knew long journey home
looked fellow traveller canoe
no longer looked like lord ordinary man felt known long time
real name
asked
gazed quizzically replied
yes time knew real name
call emerald lord rate
paused looked directly eye
name finder may call

faltered
yes know said softly
one day tell tale work also something else

asked
must take care
safe reach island maybe even
follower still sure
thought said swept away
never said killed
follower easily stopped like living thing
no hope put scent
keep trying find
lets go said picked paddle
first mile uneventful
old canal passable care locks unusable water poured bypass cuttings sluices become blocked broken
equipment seized lack use jammed shut farmers preserve water scarce
lifted craft around three locks entered long twisting stretch waterway passed across flat plain
current sluggish
debris littered bed river projected haphazardly water lurked dangerously surface
navigated way slowly obstacles clear water ahead
shallow bottomed canoe enabled maintain reasonable speed despite dangers
finder proved good travelling companion boat emerald lord horse
knew much country travelling maintained commentary places passed
pointed features landscape often told histories
people region
farming area water disappeared farms mostly empty demise population dwindled
consequently passage downstream remained largely unnoticed
seen place patchwork miniature world heights snowy mountains
seemed indistinct like model landscape distance
reality place quite different impression received
overall tidiness soft misty quality myriad farms fields really scene gentle desolation nature attempting reclaim piece world
nature requires earth air sun water
already banks old canal begun green new growth
grasses plants changed hue within days river refilling
desert brown filled distance ahead water barely reached roots river bank yet behind trees seemed almost luxuriant comparison
new green world arising like phoenix sun scorched earth
rhythm paddles creak wood slow rush water reached ears like words air even thought finder began sing
end day approached found small backwater provide safety shelter night
long slow sunset plains glowed wispy fiery orange clouds quietly melded deep crimson dulled frosty night
traced course river twilight twisting silken mists rose water hung like vaporous wraiths evening air
forgotten sounds returned river bank splash otter slipping current rush ducks wings landed emerald brown spray creamy foam
sounds occasional whisper water wandering dark beautiful quiet
absolute silence fear perceptible silence countryside beside river night unbroken interference man
atmosphere trust like gentle caress fluid whisperings stroked mind perfect pure peace
talked quietly long night looked dark star sprinkled sky
looked like pollen dust bed black velvet
silver gibbous moon rose journey void
told finder adventures big city subterranean passage beneath city streets journey across marshes boat
turn told lords caught small town beyond marsh
followed woods found follower strange wolf men
lonely yew wood busy place night
tell follower said
finder remained grimly quiet talk
wait light replied
wolfe questioned
believe wolfe saw no longer never know certainty
clever thoughtful man become corrupted boredom life
wanted something everyday existence
thought substance life greater eating sleeping day day routine
thought ordinary life prison
believe wrong structure key freedom
structure life takes care earthly needs allows enjoy spiritual freedom abide uncertain world
answer old man much older lords double cross
lived erebos many years
lived travelled far wide many years
course known wolfe called white lord one company
way leader lords double cross like leaders found really slave people without no power
one reason interested possession jealous power appeared give
wished power alone control
although knew white crystal indeed became obsessed understand failed make magic work
discovered white crystal also possessed secret made work needed able use
decided obtain secret well rather think sought destroy
showed furnace beneath house said
sure ended flames
mean really molten pool
heard finders turn surprised
killed replied finder earnestly
sure intention

understand finder
see go realise isnt real magic white crystal said
good luck bad luck surrounding equal measure
hard work sweet enjoyment no magic
things happened life world work
understand
power

perhaps started wasnt even
finder stopped paddling looking spoke
harry words kind magic
first time white crystal owner understand spell
said profound true
journey yet far go time essence
yes time essence thing
want understand
need understand crystals sake
finder looked surprised continued
erebos sleeping
dam mountain taken water away balance place disturbed
earth cracked results saw felt
much came pass foreseen hidden power erebos terrifying surprise
lords first feared wolfe wrought terror found missing thought worst occurred
may yet chance start anew
think turn start early tomorrow
shuddered thought molten pool wolfe intended destiny
talked little travellers travelling settling sleep deep undisturbed anything dreams
wednesday morning awoke sun although see
moored canoe centre waterway safety looked across water
saw wren hopping fitfully undergrowth river bank watched delight movement beyond reeds suddenly disturbed tiny bird
felt coldness sweep put hand wake finder still sleeping
woke quickly followed gaze something large moved swiftly away close ground

whispered
know finder replied urgency voice
must move soon
day dawned cloudy grey
cold mists threaded silvery strands water
clouds stretched single featureless blanket across visible world
chill air feel autumn coming
made hasty breakfast washing renewed waters river went swiftly way
day night passed without event time seamless clouds
paddled stealthily downstream aided current canal become choked weeds silt frequently forced drag canoe along banks
progress slow steady evening ready rest
despite tiredness took turns sleep watch night mindful former visitor
coldness blackness seemed interminable remained quiet
thursday bypassed numerous locks river descended coastal plain
hard work lifting dragging canoe around dozens lock gates travelled short distance morning
journey home started wave relief pleasure changed
felt uncertain nervous
progress slowed every day
became acutely aware every sound motion
searched banks constantly movement place
finder become quiet watchful
neither spoke name knew somewhere close hand ever open eyes follower

come town wish experience madness
several times heard strange sounds caught breath no sightings wolf men journey far
finder weary determined rest close town morning
made way marshes side small creek away main river
air hummed sound insects
no breeze sun shone like bloody red disc haze
billowing cumulus piling horizon
evening meal familiar mists descended shroud
tonight temperature drop air grew ever muggier
hear storm grumbling far distance decided spread tarpaulin canoe
crouched dark hood canvas supported paddles rope almost cosy
slept first long awoke flash lightning crash thunder
rain drummed tarpaulin inches head bounced water around canoe
grown cold rain blew open ends shelter
finder sat hunched cover faced night
lightning flooded darkness brief cold flashlight momentarily exposed world outside motion suspended
see far place creek bank one side ten feet away
finder swung canoe around face bank avoid worst soaking
storm abating flashes still traced clouds

finder pulled rope net tightened around
torches dropped water died

thing ageless ancient terrifying yet
suddenly began see little chink light understanding finder told
made no reply wondered follower shadow end days
good evil
paddled silence
canal cut circuitous route away streams crystal followed outward journey
curved broad path across plain
many streams fed part river people continued maintain use canal construction dam
original purpose cargo transport changed years barges travelled along old waterway modern times
passed many pleasure boats moored near locks seemed deserted
final stretch river ahead big city empty travellers boats
old passage river city forgotten channel silted blocked long way grating stood entrance tunnel
river entered marsh
water shallow paddling waded dragging canoe behind
smog bound city sat quietly horizon like giant grey pink crab growing larger every mile travelled towards
became aware change two miles airport perimeter sight distant buildings outer city
airport silent
no planes taking landing although see activity farther side
city folk diverted approach tunnel entrance built airport channel curved right petered bank silt
climbed bank found old channel river entered tunnels grating
scene devastation
tunnel collapsed
bricks rubble mixed mud debris filled dozens wide trenches slashed across airport like branches tree
fallen tunnels cut runways two
looking distance saw ruined remains old underground river channel
looked though gigantic knife cut city half
earthquake struck parts released river centuries underground captivity
one brief violent movement dramatically revealed unknowing uncaring city dwelt arrogantly ignorantly
destruction great allow passage water
abandoned canoe lifted possessions onto backs
cant believe place chrissy came
seems age away
somewhere round caught fish cooked told finder
started walking big city
kept line river best piles rubble destruction prevented walking directly along
covered wide flat expanse airport
took hours clamber across many small channels
last came perimeter climbed tumble security fence city outskirts
everywhere people city clearing mess rubble conduits water surprised
gangs men women laboured build temporary shelters place broken houses
tireless working folk put aside fashion finery seemed quite different ones seen outward journey
stopped looked passed
completely inconspicuous
another pair carrying possessions backs heading somewhere else
story times
realised way people dress behave day day flow soul
become followers ephemeral slight social fashion
real people digging survival
despite adversity maybe seemed happier
probably seen people angrily driving useless cars crowded streets
yet knew time circumstance divided two peoples still
taken disaster life threatening shock system bring real citizen heartwood beneath veneer fashion modernity
every district city river cut across main roads left almost useless condition
hastily erected footbridges enabled pedestrians cross old river recently returned
walked carrying loads seven eastern districts big city park stood big city gang
green acres covered thousands tents
city within city
scar old river ran mass tumbled masonry rubble
slight silvery reflection waters river visible beneath fallen tunnel
looking around see elegant buildings perimeter park place tall modern hotels empty space behind screen trees
quake razed famous buildings
workmen busy erecting fences around heaps tangled steel concrete
looked like city war
skyscrapers destined never replaced
lesson learnt
came dell beside river formed pool
fallen trees covered ground
dozens people queuing fill water buckets
water hole buzzing chatter rested fallen trunk eat lunch
sat beside trees old woman walked rivers edge knelt
cupped hands lifted water lips whispered air
well never
old woman walked spoke
never believed girl right know
told
like food
asked
yes please dear
havent eaten today
got bit lost trying find queue continued
know girl came saw tell found
found
asked half guessing reply
called secret river
said still see park
never believe never believe bless no
one day came round horse

crystal said
crystal help laughing joy thought
every turn
well never old lady looked hard
yes thats right
yes crystal
hope shes alright
looked dell stood duffy crystal horse
penny thoughts said finder chewing piece cheese

thinking
friends used live underground near river
dont suppose theres much chance survived
old lady took leave shambled along edge tumbledown masonry marked passage river
meal moved city passed back seven western districts
weather warmer metropolis season less obvious
air seemed strangely still no sounds except natural sounds
no traffic choked atmosphere people walked centre carriageway
city returned short people
passed street close shopping district saw solitary horse trotting towards
carless city horse seemed quite keeping
horse looked moment whinnied turned continued way
recognised look eye smiled speak
late friday evening finally arrived quayside sun already lay hidden horizon
silhouettes warehouses cranes seemed familiar almost homely
stood two quiet shadows beside docks
looked around remembering
must try find big city gang said
hope suffered quake lived tunnels
nobody finds harry
said familiar voice darkness
gloom night detected figures walking towards
one approached stood feet away
tuffy spoke

tuffys command gang disappeared shadows returned eight old bicycles

asked
roads aint get good said muffy
got one invisible mate said huffy proudly
everyone laughed huffy turned little pink dark
journeyed creaking convoy city centre arrived little midnight
pleasure palace deserted
place amusement park closed repairs earthquake damaged rides
gang easily broke main gates rode empty car park style amazement singing big city anthem
left gates swinging tuffy led low dark building edge pleasure palace
duffy forced doors gemmy entered alone
torch tuffy told use unless
others left walked centre completely black space
dark intense almost feel pressing skin
twenty paces stopped turned waited
lesser dark square doors stood open inviting
nothing moved silence hummed ears
waited watched grey space ahead
without senses began lose panicked run shadow suddenly appeared
silent black figure wide brimmed hat deeper black dark grey doorway
thought standing still first although no sound shadow slowly grew knew approaching place stood
grey square behind shadow figure suddenly silently disappeared absolute blackness
no escape
follower time
held white crystal darkness
began emit thin pure white sparkling light
light slowly grew around tiny points star light appeared darkness
follower emerged grey shadows front outstretched arm
reached towards crystal stopped invisible hand inches
stayed absolutely still
stopped breathing
arm moved forward follower deliberately clamped crystal fingers
felt icy chill touched
thought heart stop
felt senses reeling
moment tested felt give way turn run
caught glimpse crystal minds eye smiling knew free knew tide turning
crystal mine said
life
free
voice sounded halting timid quiet sound somehow built confidence repeated words much louder much clearer
life
free
moment felt fingers grip pause
crystal mine repeated
life
free despite heard voice commanding ego sum dominus temporis
heard hiss nooooo
repeated words three times ego sum dominus temporis
ego sum dominus temporis
ego sum dominus temporis
felt something change grip
suddenly released hand crystal remained aloft
felt strong much stronger anyone stronger small world men heard laugh scorn
tempted
free voice stern
choose

free time voice reverberated around space
ego sum dominus temporis
glimmering light suddenly flared around hundreds stars exploded glaring blinding flares
follower spun around fury holding hands face
ancient figure began produce wailing sigh grew searing shriek
ran edge chamber crashed mirror wall
turned ran frantically side side colliding walls shrieking
seemed search door hall mirrors lost thousand reflections cascaded away directions
stood steadfastly still waited end come
followers appearance began change liquid features slowly filled vacant shadows beneath cloak
first saw face hands surrounding reflections cascading mirrors
burning frightened eyes looked
face passed lifetime minute
ancient man stopped stared wildly looked directly lunged forward strike crystal
stood ground waiting blow fall
harry attacked reflection huge mirror shattered fragments feet
follower fell slowly ground despairing sigh rolled onto back
looked older still tired sad
lay motionless silent features changing aged beyond realms mankind kingdom ancients
moved beside looked
tears dropped cheeks
seemed harmless weak old man
face wrinkled small like monkey fathomless eyes looked across years age
felt pity super natural creature yet one kind
skin face began shrivel hoarsely whispered destruction
light faded eyes black hat sagged skeletal form visibly disintegrated
within one long minute turned heap grey ashen dust
stooped picked hat
last understood
follower gone crystal left
crystal left
crystal mine
light faded heard scraping door opened behind
big city gang moved slowly chamber finder came side
said simply
left scene death returned dock side
gang strangely quiet journey
tuffy came spoke
harry
must say good bye
know came see strong friends
look
time also come
big city gang today gone tomorrow
leave sunrise
nothing big city
people changed
discovered community
scared night ground trembled scared ever
no place gang good city
survived no star chamber secret ways removed without trace
things think maybe
no matter find new world new place mountains maybe
perhaps find source old stream
going may remember
good bye harry
bon voyage
remember free
murmur others sank shadows
good bye
blurted
go mountains good luck go
felt something well inside
wanted follow belong night
gone sudden sorrow settled stared night
shadows melted away heard no reply
felt saddened big city gang forced leave relieved well
finder remained quiet time looked away towards sea
night breeze chill salty wind dried eyes looked suidhe home lay cloaked darkness
walked silent streets ferry terminal
closed deserted sign outside announced resumption island service morning
spent uncomfortable night half sleeping grimy bench
travelling companion remained silent often wandered seemingly troubled
saturday early morning dawned grey cool
looked across sea towards island see
often mist descended across horizon miles land
collected bags walked door
no electric power building dark
large halls corridors within bustle travellers usually roamed day night vacant
rather dowdy man came door directed around side building car parks yards ferry waited
looked deserted
passengers boarded
crew waved aboard young seaman told need ticket journey
boat waited appointed time depart no passengers arrived
finder paced deck kept looking across wilderness empty car parks deserted roads sailors prepared boat leave
said nothing felt sure looking something
surely follower
ferry slipped moorings engines roared
vessel moved harbour channel
companion turn head shelter cabin
squall rain splattered across decks opened door stairway
descended saloon
five silent men sat benches surrounding wall looked almost statuesque
sight friends finder burst smile strode forward open armed meet
stood lords double cross dressed plain clothes greeted silence
port fading view behind wall approaching rain
ahead clouds clung sea
boat moved seemed world outside vessel dream
minutes later big city disappeared behind island yet revealed ahead
isolation empty place ocean filled strange foreboding
mind ached confusion tiredness
sat away companions seemed part larger thing one piece play already written
essence
six world worn travellers looked time gold lord spoke
harry said journey almost
pleased return home
surprised find
one day meet different place different time
ask anything except
suidhe comes view go aloft return island manner left
guardian white crystal rest days pay keep belongs island
things appear change remain things appear always changing
life grow older yet
time takes around circles experience
gold lord quiet find reply
quiet voice finder reciting another travelling poem broke thin silence surrounded
words seemed old stony minstrel told final tale
ferry cruised white fog slight shimmer blue showed across bows
rain speckled windows brightened boat emerged real world
showers lay behind ahead early morning sun burnished ocean golden light gilds autumn storms
felt blood return veins
head became flushed
something deep homely welled surface thoughts
walked unsteadily stairs deck
turning towards bow saw horizon covered green grey blue
cloud covered hills island island
suidhe home
bracing wind blew across face feel
tears trickled like rain cheeks aware
immense happiness filled overflowing familiar shape land steadily grew completed vision
seagulls chased noisily overhead
made way back place hidden outward journey thought gold lords words
understood
took white crystal hand
whispered wind ego sum dominus temporis
even island reappeared fell spell
one last time held stone hand
know
walked saloon open doors no faces turned
wondered see travelling different time
went back deck
wind blew hair
laughed loud joy waited home return
decide
felt truly free
ferry entered harbour drew dock
crew secured six lords waited cross shore
followed behind found walking land loved
ground felt firm beneath feet returned sea wall found alcove
hand released crystal
worn tired emotion
sat head nodded heard sea sloshing harbour wall dream
opened eyes inexplicably closed
yawned blinked lifted heavy head
sky clouded
morning grey damp musty smell autumn air
feeling dreaming filled mind like silent questioner
held head listened quiet except slow wash sea sound wind ears
looked
far side harbour high cliff old house saw solitary figure looking
something memory moved wondered distant man might
sat watching boat dock workers unloaded post cargo
handful passengers arrived board ferry back big city
recognised
time spent mainland seemed slipped away
sat watched harbour life done
felt never away yet knew
put hand pocket prove
hard shape brooch crystal given night left erebos given old coin sgurr cavan
took brooch looked
small almost insignificant thing seemed
simple gold shape fish set single glistening stone
wondered ever see
stood remembering lords double cross looked around see still harbour
gone
slept much night began feel drunk sleeplessness
still early morning looked like rain
walked slowly away harbour narrow street house top hill
curtains drawn across windows
parents yet
slipped around back house ledge garden amazement found window open left
heaved duffel bag climbed house quietly
shut window behind stood room
leaving clothes floor climbed bed
first proper bed slept since leaving erebos
warm sheets heavenly
snuggled within looked around small room
tired eyes closing
mantelpiece pictures wall calendar still showing day left blissfully familiar essence comfort security home
within seconds asleep
chapter ten two hearts chrissy dismounted neptune walked along dusty track towards farm home
knew happy
wishes come true yet something still dragged feet made sluggish
doubt mind
find reached old house fields
far go soon close familiar places childhood changed
sight dusty dry land made chrissy feel sad
hedges trees already brown skeletal leaves half fallen
no birds sky
strange weary silence weighed heavily upon ears oppressed thoughts
sound soft fall shoes quiet clop horse
slowed almost standstill approached final corner
chrissy took deep breath walked firmly farmhouse came view
sight old house took thoughts worry mind
heart leapt back home led horse yard
opened creaking door slowly
moment thought house empty
heart faltered everyone
no one came greet hear no sound within
chrissy walked across threshold stood gloom kitchen
heart beating fast
suddenly freeway bess two old dogs raced across room jumped
tails wagging excited eyes shining happiness
threw pack hugged dogs affectionately
freeway bess
ive missed
silly old things exclaimed
picked bag stood silently listening
chrissy looked tears glistened eyes called mum dad home waited
hurried clattering feet stairs round moony face mother stared disbelievingly across room
father followed wife kitchen three stood moment silence
dogs moved chasing tails scampering across room excitement
chrissy dropped bag floor
began laugh running mother embraced
looked father said happy home
everything right
dam gone father
saw go
stood saw go
believe adventures
say something please say something
father stood absolutely still
flickering dark eyes looked straight daughter
raised hands let great bellowing laugh
chrissy laughed hugged
days later early morning sun climbed hills distance
familiar backdrop snowy mountains glinted rosy light
chrissy father already planning day
much farm
chrissys return catalyst action
engrossed plan
together build best farm heartland
crops failed year next year ready great harvest
stood yard poring large plan farm sound voices broke silence chrissy looked
saw group bedraggled weary figures walking along track
two pulling old cart piled bulging sacks boxes
recognised immediately caught fathers arm
five youths strolled nonchalantly yard
one walked ahead hands pockets kicked dirt worn shoes
stopped stood front chrissy father
freeway bess stood snarling intruders
dusty city clothes youths incongruous outlandish countryside
chrissy stifled laugh surveyed five dissimilar lads
supremely confident city awkwardly scuffling dirt farmyard
chrissy called dogs heel whistle
chrissys father began speak daughter interrupted
tuffy muffy huffy puffy duffy

revellers particularly noticed farmers celebrated moment
walked night brought home bride
came pass two white crystals returned island united
years passed grown content
passage time much affected island remains haven peace refuge modern world
live happily old bedroom sleeps son
sometimes wonder find big city
never left island somehow know never
keep promise made without difficulty
hear much meet tell world outside enough
say big city water ever changing
river hidden runs proudly city dividing joining
people built twelve beautiful bridges across waters
river trees lining length gardens dip waters either side
people go relax friends ducks geese swans live happily
boats glide bridges barges sail docks carrying cargoes produce heartland farms
river also supplies city drinking water even driest weather enough
today big city famous beautiful river elegant bridges
course still busy place full people cars commerce somehow little better
identity farmers remain mystery long
big city gang gone never forget
farmers families known
told lives country helped chrissy rebuild fathers farm
tuffy come alone house day wedding asked see chrissy
pressed hand went walk briefly
known early days adventure tuffy suitor chrissys hand
weighed heavily mind realised last ten years seen almost every day
respect tuffy grew knowledge felt sad years passed never took wife
dam snowy mountains remains broken symbol hopeless past power exists old earth
big city need longer
river runs natural course farms heartland although folks still look back old times dam
farms bigger less isolated new roads cars
river central feature heartland attracts many tourists cruise old canal restored
many people stay farms summer camp foothills snowy mountains
place used erebos become holiday resort
large lake formed grounds old house bubbling surface centre famous hot spring elysium
settlers built small town hotels camping sites lake shore
people go take waters
people invented legends telling old man lived submerged house beneath lake mystical caverns
course no one really believes tales already legends
snowy mountains remain unchanged
wild rocky peaks still home eagles
wolves sometimes heard cry moonlit nights
shepherds still graze flocks higher pastures brief summer months fewer shepherds
hardy walkers climbers spend time mountains summer essence place remains
no earthquakes rumbling rattling great stone hills
great quake became known seems stabilised region
island suidhe life continues always done
new people come live
sea crossing protection place
many visitors come summer months rarely find heart island
come look quaint little towns lie beaches
come escape stay
still fishermen sail boats harbour day
one ferry still plies waters fro city folk find hard live without cars television daily papers
none things
lack man made ephemeral things make island special place live although islanders realise
stand window night watch across waves lights big city sparkling waters hovering like tiny insects night sky
look somehow see beyond dim distance time
feel icy cool breeze blow sea snowy mountains
know somewhere deep lake elysium lies remains wolfe never found earthquake
molten rock falling stone sealed passages leading old mines
sometimes think past taken quality dream seems cross boundaries invention reality
know future lead either although may find past no longer permitted witness future chrissy
years pass son grows
barely child quite man
think room
walk window
stand watch skies singular distant light barely perceptible traces arc heavens
comet perhaps tell
although see know already passed long time ago since light crossing vast empty distance
see isnt traveller space time
watch moment longer understand little
leave open window sit desk pick pen write sit room look dark window see across mainland big city
lights city shine twinkle horizon like distant fairground floating sea black
later put pen turn light
late writing half night
go window look first light approaching dawn
late sleep tonight put coat take old broad brimmed hat peg
walk cliffs harbour
cleve stand watch endless motion sea
wave different yet somehow
see small shadow figure moving harbour wall feel cold shiver pass
go home find
upstairs old room window open bed empty
white crystal travelling lords double cross soon gathering
sit unable move moment minds eye seem see far away beneath snowy mountains wizened face strange white haired old man looking night castle tower waiting
gather together walk back home
climb stairs open door old room find son still peacefully sleeping
epilogue white light reflected high skies invading earthly space
comet landed endures eyes captured one race
remember time looked stone still fire heart ice
truth together lives ever light night eyes

sick carnage americans went looking scapegoat many cases soldiers fighting dying singled
chapter low dark clouds raced across sky driven bone chilling wind accentuating cold dreary day
raw wind moaned branches bare trees tumbling last fallen leaves along ground
lonesome call crow hidden among big trees back old cemetery added somber mood
toward front small gathering people stood around open grave cold wind pulling warm clothing
crows persistent calling caught attention one group fiftyish looking man long gray overcoat head bare
turned head direction birds call looking deep gloomy old graveyard
glad isnt way back thought paused depressing enough

seen new war movies stark reality saving private ryan moved hearing details someone experienced something terrifying raw left manny feeling left
no wonder never said anything war
hell explained something like bunch spoiled children like
entered state georgia got dark full moon rising horizon
manny left main highway opting back roads sometime around midnight
full moon zenith night sky bathing highway surrounding landscape soft white light
drove came long skinny lake surrounded trees small hills
lakes surface gleamed silver moonlight
turned onto small paved road heading away water heading deeper surrounding forest
road meandered valley flanked large trees thick brush
rounded corner pulled small overlook right side road
ground dropped away road
manny tired driving stopped car
heavy growth along sides road looked almost impenetrable
wasnt sure looking got car walked thick vegetation
parted first layer tangle bushes large trees spread branches road
enough moons light filtering trees manny see little stepped road forest
manny crashed thick undergrowth feet ready turn around came break foliage
wasnt much appeared game trail
manny still walk bent take advantage trail continued
trail moved left gradually descending hill
hundred feet ahead trail reached bottom slope started gradually next hill
vegetation next hill little less dense many large trees shielded ground direct sunlight
part way slope manny came rock cap outcrop granite forming large bald spot ever encompassing vegetation
manny detoured little left going smooth rock
climbing harder angle slightly steeper difficult getting solid footing
smooth cap coated thin film tiny grains sand
manny climbed outcrop dove back earth vegetation took
larger trees undergrowth less dense manny see large rocks protruding crest hill
manny found small nitch near crest hill spot two feet square large spreading tree
large rocks standing high behind formed top hill
see slope front sides rear protected rocks
manny made comfortable rocks cold damp night air surrounding
coming
save
know
said loud
nothing smuck
youre retail exec lot experience anything counts
youre damn lucky live placid environment otherwise toast
manny huddled tree knees pulled tight chest arms wrapped around legs looking moonlight thinking
wonder bow good

soldier thinks
going make hell going take many
brave
makes person charge certain death angry
causes line crossed scared angry
wonder handle
manny contemplated problem fantasied making stand got cold returned car

say
sometimes officers try incorporate field company operations walk point dig bunkers stand guard things like guys didnt like grab villager escort rear

georges massive weight drove toward icy roadway
attacker got lucky georges momentum carried huge dog loosening crushing grip arm spinning around temporarily separated
man ended knees george stretched slippery road legs splayed churning slipping trying get back feet renew assault

chapter one big city lights late night outside black
small wooden box lies open hold two clear gemstones hand
firelight plays across facets crystals
remember
book lies open desk turn read words written
desk light reflects black glass window
town dark silently asleep
open window hear sea breaks shore
everything island close sea
smell salt seaweed permeates fabric lives
wash waves fiery crackle pebbles rasping beach play constant background rhythm every thought
sea clouds part moment
sudden glance moonlight wave tops momentary flowing canvas deep marine blue caresses eyes like mirage
sensations always near
clouds close yet deep night still sense movement sea far
mind wanders beyond confines night island home suidhe
sea controls lives everyone
live die water weather
ever changing exudes emotion temper free like living thing
seen gentlest waters kiss rocks murmuring ebb flow
felt earth jarring beneath shuddering crash stormy mountain waves shout rocks anger
either side town low earthy cliffs rise pebbly beaches
glistening peaty streams tumble waterfalls shore waves
late summer seals bask play rocks emerge water like broken teeth beyond cliffs
endless turmoil gulls patrols sky
eastern coast sheltered extremes weather softer gentler exposed western shore
rocky coves inlets hidden folds hills reach green fingers island touch waters edge
streams rise springs hills centre island fall dancing small ravines
gather river flows across plateau sea cliffs
waters surge final valley pass stony estuary shelters steep wooded hills old bridge
small town home lies lowest part coast
face bravely across water towards mainland big city glistening ribbon light horizon
mainland town modest village small island centre living proudly considered town
oldford quiet slow settled place winding streets climb harbour
old houses rise stony ground either side steep lanes
stand one seems one perches roof house
stone walls hewn old quarries hills even roofs tiled slabs stone
old houses emerge hills seamless continuity grey hard
yet stone softened ages weathered walls covered lichens moss pillows roofs
western side island storms blow wild windy vastness empty ocean batter ragged shore
gulls gannets noisily cruise air stony heights ceaseless waves
cool dark caves pierce steeper cliffs issuing streams ferny shadows
trees grow salty wind stunts growth living things
one sheltered inlet hides behind spur rock curves around small bay foaming sea pounds turbulently entrance natural harbour
carves rocks cliffs gullies rise fall stormy tides
small fishing village newbridge shelters gap ragged cliffs
grey brown rock walls protect worst winter gales
buildings cluster around inner harbour
tiny bleak shed like cottages solid low
small shuttered windows heavily braced doors
wildest winter penetrate solid white walls
inside parlour cosy place rosy cheer peat firelight flickers faces friendly warmth
whitewashed walls turf covered roofs home no hundred inhabitants four families
dozen small fishing boats rest keels mud awaiting tide rise
stalwart fishermen uncles cousins sons fathers sail sea
meantime boats womenfolk keep house garden praying good weather good catch safe return
life suidhe always weather
midnight storms give way silent calm dawns
bluster winds free days monotony drumming rain
strange enclosing fog binds everything cold close wet white
clouds fade quickly sun rise perfect blue mornings bathed happiness refreshing early light
oldford newbridge settlements island
single road rises valleys cliffs winds way
follows coastline around past south point stony haven
centre island hilly roads traverse
goat tracks old drovers ways twist climb way tight valleys reach broken moors surround rocky heart tracks narrow ways
south east valleys spread small fields cultivated centuries fishermens wives tilled land men folk sea
north west remain untamed wild great herds deer roam freely valleys call deer gardens
spent childhood island
many children fewer today
free time filled lives ancient pastimes uncorrupted modern world
helped home
helped crops animals
helped boats weather fine
playing exploring adventuring together alone came know understand island home
spent evenings fire families alone reading rooms
distant sound voices raised song issued houses tavern break silence dark winter evenings
thought old ways never end others less comfortable saw idyll harsher reality
adrift ocean twinkling lights horizon stayed ever present minds
stood curving coaxing thoughts temptation cross sea
life island changing
still insular completely isolated mainland
early every morning ferry came dock harbour bringing provisions visitors
returned mainland taking men island big city worked
evening ferry repeated trip
ferry became lifeline regular tides
without no longer survive
late hear parlour clock striking two calling sleep
work little longer
tell
name harold small harry everyone knows
live old cottage near steep top steep hill oldford overlooks harbour sea
sometimes autumn days see smoke rising lazily squat chimneys drifts hangs pall valley obscures cottages
sit room look dark window see across mainland big city
lights city shine twinkle horizon like distant fairground floating sea black
look lights remember back lad thirty years ago things
see went big city long time ago story came go shall never go back
see quite clearly mind
late summer holidays sixteenth year went old harbour oldford
loved island eager teenager
wanted change chance break free close confines
yearned distance excitement life grander scale
much always dreamed going sea big city
nights long dark get go front window look across water watch shimmering horizon
night dream life big city glittering lights glittering dreams dreams no hold reality
island ancient remote years ago roads stony paths
boy vehicles island two three old tractors bicycles
longed much see exciting things heard longed big city night see big city lights
instead sitting quayside watching others go
best friend lad age called frank big city father twice year
never stopped talking sights cars shops ships people
everything seen biggest brightest grandest best wanted see
see roads harry theyre wide long straight
theyve got golden fountains city square shaped like lions much bigger
buildings high cant see roof

franks going persisted
one day no doubt see
tell life hard big city
glitters gold know
knew father exaggerating
best friends father went month always came back
wasnt father hard man unfriendly
teacher island school inclined jovial serious
got along fine something big city didnt like made seem fascinating
often sat harbour making plans escape adventure
hill behind house curved steeply jagged cliff passed within feet walls
no one watching possible jump rear window onto ledge rock jutted back garden
sometimes creep secretly leave window open return
father horrified angry known foolish leap across
never entered thoughts might dangerous
slip silently harbour one evening dark climb aboard ferry sailed able hide away board
arrived mainland explore big city night
ferry returned island morning run hill climb house time go downstairs breakfast
no one ever know away secret
plan never work course
problems seemed insurmountable
avoid seen
board ferry without buying ticket
certainly afford fare
never gave thought happen caught
racked brains weeks without success find way crossing sea rejected idea outset
island isolation seemed complete one day something happened gave illogical hope plan
close centre island hill called sgurr cavan raises rocky summit higher others
view sea around compass top
islanders call temple wind
good name always windy
heard old island legend place no one seemed know
knew something going mainland
time passed found nothing
asked people old legend laughed worse wanted know interested
course couldnt tell
concluded no one knew information sought
every day whatever weather old fisherman wander slowly quayside watch boats
name eric although everyone called old eric
boat crews knew stop tell news sea
loved hear tales tell
always sat special bench overlooking harbour wall soon noticed new interest place
course knew
everyone knew school masters son
sat beside old eric one day
nut brown old face held twinkling clear eyes half hidden beneath thick bushy eyebrows
years sharp sea air roughened skin made swarthy
seemed old wise neptune
sat wondered many ships sailed many lands seen
looked intently pretended gaze sea
say boy
rasped old eric
ear want tknow bout legends laughed
laughed often like sound cackling crow raucous broken
folks dont want tknow bout legends days boy
theyre busy young modern much hurry tunderstand legends harry

really want know insisted
tell olden days temple wind
looked earnestly caught eye
moment couldnt look away
felt tested
got boy
sit tight ill tell tale
bent close looked fiercely
first must swear youll never repeat word folk dont live ere
island lore no big city stuff ere boy
old fingers stabbed air direction mainland lowered voice hoarse whisper
must never know secrets
swear promise young
yes yes stammered
swear
hard penetrating gaze old man scared spoke
turned away looked across water story began
long time ago say lived extraordinary man came suidhe
traveller magician doin magic pay
magician great tall man white flowing hair strange ways
large black cape hed wear cover
imposing figure
stood crowd might say
bright eyes set old mans face
never walked slowly
wherever went took mighty strides like man purpose mind
folk thought entertainer played games magic
others took seriously
name although real name couldnt say
called mythras ancient myth
old eric took pipe started methodically stuff bowl tobacco continued tale
stayed entertained high folk elders
cast spells keep away vermin
tis said mythras magic water make people laugh cry
talked stars planets earth
one thing folk wanted see kept hidden except special chose
small wooden box inlaid mother pearl carved fancy patterns magical signs
say made box wood special tree distant land
inside box kept massive gem stone
pale glassy crystal magic change colour
seemed glow looked
looked drawn like looking lovers eyes
stories tell looked magic stone never forget
glowed formed pictures mind like embers fire
crystal pictures filled dreams patterns light stretched back night
minister chapel time strict like
took dislike magician called charlatan bad man
made folk believe magician evil fraud
magic aint possible said
folk superstitious believin days magician made welcome longer
long packed bag leave
mythras went harbour right hire passage mainland big city
none locals take scared
people got together chased edge town told magic away wait boat mainland folk take
told come back town
magician stopped turned turn stopped faced
looked magnificent flowing beard glowing eyes
children hid behind mothers skirts
men wavered felt power
magic none strong man piercing eyes blazed
spoke grand voice saying curse
refused passage treat like criminal yet done no harm
helped many times knew repay
call fraud cast spell see truth
none ever leave island live
present smallest child held captive place
try get away succeed die trying
leave see remember
yes
remember
saying turned walked hill leaving islanders gaping silent
nobody moved spellbound
mythras made way centre island climbed sgurr cavan summit
stood place silhouetted lurid sky raised hands cast spell whole island suidhe
almost great storm began rise horizon dark clouds filled sky around
got dark like eclipse
strange spinning wind came racing across seas towards island
islanders hear screeching like hundreds wailing souls
storm began many ran shelter fearing work devil
sky black night lightning forked like snakes tongues close folk hear hiss crackle
billowing clouds formed tension filled air
men ran harbour secure boats
rain began
great heavy sheets water swept across harbour lashed strange dark vortex came closer
cry went tornado take cover
run run run lives
voice lost screaming wind
whirling fountain air seemed alive sucked jets seawater consumed anything fell swirling cauldron base
fearing safety men abandoned boats struggled chapel
time stone building town
chapel bell swinging wildly steeple pealing disaster
inside folk gathered wondering praying
children screamed window glass blew tiles ripped roof
noise awful place seemed filled fearful madness
outside tornado rushed across island like mad wild thing terrifying animals pulling anything path
say went right summit sgurr cavan plucked magician stood placid arms raised waiting
chapel people found minister cowering corner whimpering pathetically
attempts talk failed
said day storm hear man whimpering chapel tis likely wind flue
storm died quickly come
folk tell winds like sound ghosts laughing sped horizon
island everything soaked heavy rain
torrents gouged ruts roads swept away bridge
everywhere trees leaning fallen across paths
broken boughs crashed onto roofs
animals fields broken fences ran wildly panic stricken place place
worst boats harbour lay smashed submerged gaping
splintered wood strewn across decks
single craft left endure dangerous journey mainland
seemed magician exacted terrible revenge islanders
yet incredibly except ordeal experience downfallen minister one islanders come real harm storm
elders satisfied everyone well sent team young men salvage harbour
without boats fishing knew soon starve
others dispatched attend old young houses clear town best
knew long task
many weeks passed normality return many years pass curse finally forgotten
next day five men set climb top sgurr cavan find magician
hoped found armed case trouble
got closer sgurr cavan devastation increased
stunted trees bushes ripped away lower slopes
close summit hill vast amphitheatre shaped corrie
fearsome place storm winds gather rocks tumble
whirlwind dumped load debris across island
rocks boulders roof tiles uprooted bushes even wood boats harbour deposited like much jetsam beach yet top hill
centre bizarre strange old place found pillar glimmering rock crystal high man
none ever seen none knew come
said came ocean
others said magician turned stone
everything changed forever
good word mythras gone without trace
never seen islanders
long time passed five men told no one else seen hill
townsfolk busy repairing rebuilding bothered
magician gone mattered
weeks following storm nobody left island
memory magician said still fresh folk keen try tempt fate
need go mainland supplies urgent
days no ferry islanders fetch provisions
usually sent pair boats fortnight take produce market bring back essentials
time come go market two boats salvaged repaired
boat volunteer crew two men four men top hill storm
early morning perfect day journey
weather fine sea calm set sail mainland
many island folk watched little boats move across waters
felt happy life last returning normal also felt little uneasy
curse mythras
boats ever return minister right magician
storms unusual island although no one living ever seen tornado
sailors expected return evening late day people began gather harbour wall await boats
first star shone clear evening light daylight faded two sails approached harbour walls
exclamations relief small crowd gathered wall
evening breeze blew heavily laden boats briskly homewards
light enough see boats neared quay
last moment anyone realise something wrong
boats came low water weighed cargo
sailors surprised
hadnt sails dropped
leaving bit late whats
boats rode straight harbour wall
men scrambled help unload boxes crates discover crews gone
boats full provisions four men disappeared
no sign no clue signify vanished boats returned without crews
nothing unload supplies
days later mainland boat arrived enquiries sent back big city came nought
mystery never solved men never found
time mainland crews brought provisions beginning ferry
time passed healed wounds wrought great storm
islanders slowly forgot ordeal mythras magician
however two strange events took place time
first known top sgurr cavan seen pillar crystal
exactly one year storm strange pillar vanished
no one knew
time one dark night two boats sailed home mysteriously empty also disappeared
no one recalls magicians curse came true
generations passed many years folk witnessed great storm grown old died new minister came island
name reverend finder became interested history place
heard old tales mythras storm told yer became intrigued started investigate mystery
research called island folk didnt take
investigation didnt last long went missing whilst walking one day tis said found crystal white crystal mythras
search made wasnt found
later body man found bottom ravine western coast
appeared fallen quite dead
reverend finder anyone island
folk thought little
minded believe legends
tis said minister set walk top sgurr cavan day many miles place body found
yet seemed connection said foul play
mystery remained unsolved no one ever know happened
dont crime police solve see
heavy scent pipe tobacco faded old eric tapped pipe heel boot
put old briar back pocket spoke
young thats tell
getting late going get supper
one last word old sailor whos seen thing two time dont go meddling past
folklore old folk tell story passed generations wheres truth couldnt say
harry run along look future past
wanted speak say something
felt excited inside find right words say
mind full stories
sure must something heard something magical
old man slowly stood followed
thank cried
run along said laughed
story harry boy
turned away ran street
chapter two chrissy girl looked letter
red headed teenager tall lively grey eyes
always move even sitting fidgeting twisting constantly picking putting
wore old dirty shabby clothes patched faded jeans threadbare shirt
room sitting also haphazard
old farm kitchen hardly changed hundred years
furniture made heavy unpolished wood rough time worn appearance
plates dishes ornaments sundries covered sideboard table
freeway bess two labrador dogs lay large wicker basket front old cast iron range
dozed heads lolling black golden forepaws
despite wavering midsummer heat blowing open window mica windows door range glowed red woody embers flickered lazily casting shadows across stone flagged floor
fire burned every day no matter weather long anyone remember
old nails hooks studded blackened beams ceiling
cooking pans tools implements string onions bags herbs tankards leather belts old horseshoes thousand items accumulated many lifetimes used forgotten awaiting time occupied hooks
kitchen centre farm life meeting place office dining hall surgery occasional boarding house
old place full rafters memories histories
lives generations farm families played theatre room comedies tragedies music hall farce
echoes memories reverberated ancient walls
late morning tall thickset man wild auburn hair pallid skin walked open stable doorway
farmer father red headed girl
seemed weary angry pulled worn boots left sagging lay
shirt sleeves rolled back elbows revealed powerful arms large hands long stained fingers
wiped sweat brow large red handkerchief
chrissy rough voice boomed get tea love
sat heavily leaned across table
girl went range hot kettle stood black steaming
refilled pot let steep
room silent minute brought mug tea across room placed grey boards beside
looked thoughtfully opened mouth speak closed
okay dad
read letter

father looked gripped mug fiercely
eyes alight anger
okay shouted
no right dont know going
never worked harder killing cant
help

please let help pleaded chrissy
no
no place
mother talked
want go aunts house big city
shell look settle ill find place family
father looked straight daughter spoke mind full dam dam held back future life left empty dry
understand happened
never believed possible day river began run dry seen eyes
huge new reservoir hillside full water filled great steel pipeline snaked across plain big city
stolen water livelihood left starve loving wife beautiful daughter
water company offered move different place
offered buy farm
warned weather dry might run short never admitted truth
proud indignant hurting family suffering
dug well already dry
wanted sink borehole couldnt afford without neighbours help taken water companys money gone
turned bowed head looked dusty window
fields stretched wide across plains towards snowy mountains
farmhouse stood centre farm
ragged old track scratched across surface fields dustily tracing way towards road
farm lay farthest edge vast prairie called heartland stretched across arid miles featureless flat lands mountains sea
crows stalked fields among remains crops
dirty grey trees stood skeletal leafless plain
dusty mounds dykes showed ditches ran water
pond farmyard almost empty
inches slimy green water buzzed mosquitoes
one sad duck stood bank looking quizzically scraggy weeds
world intense fire like heat
sun seemed fill sky blazed
creatures walked bowed heads lethal light
blistered grey trunks elegant trees lined edge distant field traced path dried river bed sorry place
look outside chrissy take look
cant fill river
got go
cant wait till rains come year
wont last long
might rain weeks itll take rain river flows
know whats happened
man goes meddling nature always ends disaster
theyve undone balance thats theyve done
chrissy see anger eyes wanted stay
farm dad
cant leave
cant sell love worth bean
madman come
farmer waved hands vaguely behind
looked sullen
sound movement pierced walls door parlour opened
woman sailed dressed flowing blue
long black hair tidy bun
wore dark blue sash around slim waist delicate gold brooch shape fish dress
walked across room humming seemingly oblivious girl man already present
sad man looked wife
beautiful woman love great
crisis lives proving much
shut truth
lived make believe world pretending life go normal
conceive time leave parents farm
lived life parents grandparents lived
generations reached back first settlers one family one farm
stood went proud serene woman standing old spotless sink incongruously singing sad song soft melody
love dear said quietly
listen
chrissy must go soon
take coach little
must say good bye
wife looked
turned daughter
well gushed must get ready
dress journey
hope lovely holiday darling time come back everything fixed
chrissy looked mother saw tears eyes
even mother strength face truth
knew no return farm
mother daughter went silently upstairs
came later carrying old case
transformation taken place chrissy looked essence country society girl
older younger self possessed vulnerable
hair arranged tidily wore best clothes possessed
standing side side mother daughter presented picture pathos beauty
chrissy carried bag containing valued notebook old book poems small wooden box carved lid favourite old togs
dress wore mothers treasured brooch
outside father old car ready
seldom used rusty black relic
always gone area horseback
horses sold
cars old engine running minutes smelt hot oil idled yard
tyres cracked leather seats creaked car still worked enough one last journey highway
packed bag boot opened door daughter
chrissy started towards car hesitated looked back house silhouette mother standing open door
suddenly turned ran
chrissy
shouted father
kept running came bank old river lay desolate murky
stood looked place remembered childhood dreamy sun soaked days swum splashed cool water
years walked banks river waded clean clear waters
dozen winters seen icy beauty place
remember whispered
remember secret river good bye
looked minute longer tears welling behind eyes returning car climbing seat without word
father shut door set lane
chrissy looked back waved disbelieving mother
old jalopy bumped track billowing cloud dust slowly weaved around potholes towards dirt road
half hour later freeway chrissys father waited see daughter onto bus take big city
old grey coach came view pressed envelope hand gave kiss
thats
aunt look
take care journey sure write
remember love
good bye
minute later turned away bus faded heat haze
eyes glistening climbed back old tattered car turned around towards farm road
beneath noise car felt silence pressing
turned radio company words gave no relief
journey big city long trip chrissy felt uncomfortable fancy clothes
longed arrive turn back true self somehow knew never return old ways
aunt visited farm two three occasions chrissy young
hardly knew
want live aunt even short time
chrissy never city smart girl knew ways world country life suggested
lifes harsh realities exposed farm births deaths good times bad
even though crude sometimes brutal truthful
seen much life country dam spoilt
friends gone one one
village two miles farm slowly emptied nearly deserted
school closed
knew stay always hoped
people rare treasured heartland
possible pass someone without stopping speak
distance folk drew together
farmers shared precious possessions time
everybody helped everybody end disparate community split asunder moved apart
left alone read books whenever escaped worlds

going
sitting uncomfortable grubby seat felt life moving reality new fiction
bus trundled noisily stop stop seats filled passengers
chrissy shy
used talk everyone saw
country farm miles anywhere never felt lonely scared
travelling towards big city moving different world different order
people bus kept
felt like outsider looking
saw one pretending others visible
remained alone aloof little worlds
loneliness eyes saw hints desperation
chrissy thought friends first time life suddenly felt alone scared
bus ground chrissy sighed turned head looked dusty windows
countryside gave way scraggy hamlets hamlets turned towns
telegraph poles lined verges filled sky wires
road slowly filled traffic cars lorries bikes buses roaring rushing
wooden houses small neat towns led brick houses blocks flats
pavements side roads streetlights shops
paraphernalia urban life crowded edge road
people everywhere crossing road getting bus shouting pavements looking shops waiting cars smiling laughing crying everywhere
chrissy filled eyes sights head ached
smell exhaust stuck throat made feel ill time seemed accelerated
much going yet oddly seemed little happening except bluff fluster
felt looking dream
brick houses gave way concrete offices apartments
intersections railways enormous buildings flowed past growling bus wound way centre metropolis
finally stopped amidst fleet identical buses lined oily grey tarmac terminus
people jostled get hurried away
chrissy sat stunned silent unsure next
driver turned
hey end road girl shouted bus
aint got home go
jerked head eyes red damp
looked thought might crying
time smiled

okay
let help love
going
asked kindly
chrissy showed aunts address driver directed another bus
show driver hell tell get reassured
towards end afternoon chrissy arrived aunts apartment block
felt tired shocked total change surrounded
uncomfortable embarrassed pretty old fashioned country clothes
noise pain filled head throat dry sore
wanted anything go sleep forget
aunt slack looking woman slouching lamp post waiting bus lumbered halt
chrissy knew even greeted never never friends
jessica said aunt jessica
call jessie
going grand time
aunt jessica spoke smoky drawl incessantly punctuated drawing breath cigarette
wore scanty casual city clothes intended someone half age
aunt jessica talked unceasingly anything came head
conversation monologue meaningless
ways city important
fashion purpose life
looked pretty niece critically way made chrissy hold coat tighter protection
youre cute outfit
believe youre honey dear purred gritty voice didnt smile
aunt jessie still leaned post casually smoking cigarette
jerked head walked across throwing cigarette stub pavement
jealousy chrissys natural young beauty lay smouldering
aunt jessicas flat gaudy clothes
small rooms appeared smaller overpowered bright colours oversize patterns
ornaments furnishings filled every wall corner
clear space room reflection seemed scare
whole resembled charity shop showroom like shop never quite clean
no books seen
aunt jessica never found time read
two weeks later sun setting across city skyline
usual chrissy alone apartment high grimy litter strewn streets
knew aunt back early hours come back probably bring another friend visit
chrissy welcome
went room get ready bed changed mind went instead collect handbag go street
walk good thought longed stretch legs across miles used country
street dusty heat summer evening filled air stifling slow
people wandered scuffing feet hard pavement lazy walk
sound music mixed distant cacophony traffic freeway thousand half heard conversations drifted open windows
chrissy decided find bay knew somewhere ahead
although evening night never truly found way onto streets city
lights constant living never stopped
aunt jessica warned take care
youre sweet little lamb honey city full wolves dear
dont ever trust none specially theyre men
chrissy never felt scared company others walked
traffic choked main street outside best place find way
chrissy already discovered essential feature cities always bigger ground appear
people walked place even fewer walked pleasure
debris littered pavements roads ruled traffic
passed drivers clocked young girl wearing scruffy old clothes walking briskly erect towards unknown destination forgotten next junction
another pretty girl city full
big city divided districts unknown chrissy crossed boundary docklands district
heading towards sea passed rows tall warehouse buildings blank windowless sides
main highway spun tangent suddenly found large empty road
speeding cars trucks sped gust exhaust fumes
sound engines clattered echoed grey buildings
sky strip half light hanging street lights
no living thing seemed
road ended abruptly deserted large intersection railway line ran embedded tarmac along dockyard front
ahead chrissy see looming hulks several large ships lay tied alongside quay
tall warehouses covered loading bays rusty metal clad walls stood opposite ships
trains railway trucks waited orderly rows
gantries cranes towered bathed glare orange sodium lights shut night
occasional trucks rounded corner crawled along roadway distance
little movement close although lights peered ships moored quay
steel hawsers rusty machinery crates stacks wooden pallets
distance men busy shouting whistling loading large dull rusty red cargo ship
small plink lap water betrayed sea becalmed within docks
chrissy turned walked slowly quayside away lights men towards open bay
darkness covered followed glistening steel rails stretched along centre road
short distance passed heard low whistle one buildings
turned saw nothing
perhaps imagined
moment later another louder whistle behind
walked ahead quickly shadow stepped silently dark roadside stood path
heart pounding tense chrissy stopped dead
shadow spoke strange slurred drawl
goes
voice questioned
dont know
chrissy became aware shadows closing around found surrounded half dozen young men dressed black
stood legs apart menacingly silent
terrified spun around look
large truck turned corner drove towards
boys blinked foolishly ran suddenly appeared melting shadows different direction
chrissy ran heart thumping side road darted back towards street lights ships
truck slowed stop continued way
chrissy ran corner road town
turned hands gripped tight empty behind
walked briskly almost run daring look back city streets encounter strangers
found way aunts apartment let slammed door behind massive sigh
hands trembled fear tried lock
went bed sleep
mind filled shadows blackness surrounding

wild rocky part island completely alone except shadow
minutes later follower hastened path unaware presence

finder may found crystal mythrass box
disappeared like four sailors
adventure befallen final sunday
importance caves sgurr cavan
next day visited friend frank persuaded come temple winds search caves
prepared adventure carefully
packed torch compass
despite warm weather knew cool caves packed warm clothes plenty provisions knapsacks
climb centre island began early
long trek promised return nightfall
calculated twelve hours sunset take several hours walking way complete journey
frank walked hill edge oldford crossed old bridge across head gorge marked path river
river flowed opening low rock cliff lay head gorge
waters gathered marshes moors found way underground point
made way swiftly first along well used paths tracks threaded around many small fields orchards lay hills
several islanders harvesting crops fruit hops waved passed
jolly time fresh apples eat
walking along imagined rev
finder probably trodden paths years ago
weather fine sun rose sky day became warm
dew soaked bracken nettles grass beside paths slowly dried
looked across gently rising plain caught glimpses distant sea reflecting blue skies
refreshing sea breeze blowing across hillside cooled heat
four miles inland lush green surrounded farmsteads gave way rockier terrain
seldom used paths thereabouts became harder walk along
hour half steady walking found foot central hills
stopped refreshments surveyed scene vantage point fields
mid morning started climb hillside
paths follow often became indistinct wound across rocky outcrops
formation hills island like shelf full books half fallen sides
alternate steep rocky escarpments shallow rising pastures built fairly orderly manner towards central point
area deer gardens large herd red deer roamed across rocks pastures
sgurr cavan however different formation towered craggy haphazard fashion like giant cairn stone
dense dark almost black gabbro pierced skies
sharp ragged silhouettes rock buttresses erupted moors surmounting tawny mellow heather covered hues lower limestone slopes
even bright sun summers day sgurr cavan looked somehow cold forbidding
rock climbing necessary reach top careful footing imperative
circumnavigated jutting outcrop series steep ravines led inevitably towards central peak
runnels loose stone scree sharp glass covered steep sides valleys
deep fissures often contained narrow running streams fairly galloped slopes gathered forces reaching base hill drained peaty marshes coast
valleys rocks home goats sheep summer months passed shepherds fire circles built sheltered places
higher went colder became glad warm jackets
like many hills seen distance sgurr cavan larger higher prospect reality
sun passed zenith time frank finally walked broad corrie knife edged ridge ran summit
huge bowl shaped corrie bleak place black grey
waterfalls tumbled rocks centre
point large flat topped rock around five streams met tumbled pool
must crystal pillar stood
climbing top standing small level platform maybe ten feet across
tiny cairn loose rock invisible assembled top
normally bad luck disturb cairn leave
took rocks apart search
nothing
carefully rebuilt cairn dropped back floor corrie
ten minutes steep clambering beside one streams brought top
ecstatic tired
room sit steady unceasing wind
first time either reached top although often clambered around lower slopes
exhilaration achieving summit superb
temple wind shouted
answer voice wind blew even stronger gusts salty freshness sea
exhilarated moment made wish upon wind wish go across sea find perfect friend land big city
stood flying hair ruddy cheeks facing cold blast moving
cold even summer stay still long
frank found sheltered place close rocky path ascended
sat ate hearty lunch bread rolls cheese meat salad accompanied wholesome cordial
felt strong happy
see world knew top hill
air clear crystal great distances shrank eyes
direction mainland see big city neatly laid like perspective map far distance
buildings reflected sun million glass eyed windows
roads visible web dull black threads
tangled maze streets near centre gave way grid like suburbs outskirts
detail evaporated distance smoky heat haze hovered pall grimy cloud streets impression complete
eye looked inexorably first time see beyond big city land lay great plain reaching many miles inland
wonder see beyond plain distant mountains
almost blur haze quite definite make glimmer snow caps glinting across high ridges
view never forget
eaten climbed summit
followed horizon around past sweep mainland bays facing opposite direction
sea stretched seemingly forever horizon blended sky featureless azure arc
stood silence gazing realised time pressing
come frank cried must find came
replied
sure finders caves must far side summit towards newbridge
direction coast much nearer sea caves tunnelled inland
laboriously made way far side sgurr cavan
difficult pick path
scree dense treacherous no streams follow side summit
no sign caves rocky terrain either
little lower cliffs waterfalls scree tumbled
dangerous go see rev
finder gone way
decided descend cliffs one side try
working way around scrambled scraped way edge high moors possible approach base cliffs
many large boulders close far edge offered shelter little vegetation grew
stunted gnarled old trees no larger bushes cowered beside dark rocks shadow wind
tufts grass moss clutched clefts cracks stones
found numerous small openings behind trees
one thought found mouth cave succession proved little deep depression rock
suddenly frank shouted across two boulders little way slope
harry think hear water
ran across crawled small gap
faint metallic chime running water echoed deep nothing visible
long way said
must cave
think weve found
whispered
get
lets look around said might way lower
clinging edge slope feel head lightening effect vertigo
began climb hillside rocks difficult negotiate
scree loose boulders covered mountainous incline rattled runnels beneath feet
struggled harder became retain foothold handhold
began feel unsafe
must two hundred feet summit way cave still eluded
lets go back shouted frank
no good
dont think scree unstable
replied frank trod another loose boulder lost footing
slid tumbling hillside surrounded avalanche sharp grey grit
lay flat ground small rocks washed past
looking shouted
frank frank
no reply
dust settled no sign frank disappeared
began ease way cautiously slowly slowly like crab
suddenly saw saw frank stood
sliding scree uncovered entrance small cave miraculously frank dropped safety boulders bounded harmlessly
seconds later stood beside friend despite torn clothes unhurt
cave entrance small opened larger chamber
sun shone mouth cave gave enough light see back little way
prepared explore took torch
progress tunnel slow first became used darkness cool echoing shadows
felt increasingly insecure deepening dark ventured sight daylight
often glanced back velvet black behind
spoke low whisper avoid overheard
magic cave slowly overcame fear
entered small passage led towards centre hill
tunnel dropping
ancient walls carved solid rock wondered man nature made
hear clink drip water distance coming ever closer sound running stream
passage twisted several times seemed becoming smaller
roof low stoop continue along tunnel
feel lost one way go checking little compass found still heading towards centre hill
passage ended suddenly found standing gallery looking black void
torch revealed floor falling away mirroring roof curved
torch beam weak illuminate full extent cavern entered
stood awe struck enormity hollow mountain discovered
rock passageways dark indistinct colour walls cavern
dark
high single shaft sunlight blazed fissure roof
perhaps crack first looked
light beam pierced blackness like glowing rod struck wall
gasped saw place
wall alive radiance colour
light cascaded like furnace brilliant jewels
dancing sparkling beams shone waterfall myriad rainbows reflected roof rippling patterns cast large pool
beautiful thing grasped mind wall behind pool point rainbows ended massive eruption liquid clear white crystal
somewhere inside began understand mystery mythras mountain
found white crystal magical
frank stood rocky gallery timeless moment silently watching display slowly changed
light sun shine fissure short time day small number days year
privileged witnesses moving experience
secret hill come light another day different time
easy believe glorious fate drawn cavern
felt sure mythras must known place light window
must come island find cave obtain crystal
decided take
find secrets mythras
awoke surreal dream surrounded turned frank
realised time cause crystal vanish light moved said excited whisper
must hurry light goes
need crystal
frank question desire
frank lead crept massive chamber began cross floor towards goal
part way across cavern foot stepped something loose rock
shone torch place gasped involuntarily
lying feet disjointed bones human skeleton
stooped looked unfortunate victim
no features former corpse left lying sand close coins
picked one date
put coin pocket
mind racing
last resting place reverend finder
happened lead death
looked skeleton
gaunt white arm lay stretched pointing towards depths cavern
empty eye sockets stared face
stared back transfixed vacant glare moment frank called
put thoughts mind crossed rocks frank stood edge pool
magic light playing upon face
reason felt unable tell skeleton found
ill tell later thought
reach crystal cross pool no way go around
knelt felt icy water shivered touch
pool long narrow
waterfall showered centre flowed sedately one end
away waterfall pool completely clear carefully shining torch see bottom shelved deeply around waterfall appeared shallow close edge
go said simply
hold rope
saying took rope knapsack frank uncoiled took trousers preparing wade water
tied rope chest arms
take no risks
stepped gingerly pool shocking cold water covered skin like plunging snow
feel smooth rock bare soles feet
felt thrill run waded around pool
spray mist waterfall constantly bathed water slowly rose knees moved towards crystal
pool deeper overflow drained strength current surprised
stopped brace flow ventured
approach cascade crystal took longer expected
crystal extended water floor pool became angular sharp facets remarkable stone
light seemed float flutter
crystal bright darkness hard look directly
became illuminated rainbows able touch stone last
hoped find loose pieces
stone impressively hard touch
smooth sharp glass firmer less brittle like clear flint
find broken stone took small hammer brought bag
tested sharp crystal blunt steel shower electric blue sparks flew hammerhead
chose point broken stone hoped fall water
shielded eyes one arm struck stone hard
crack hammer like gunshot echoed reverberation
light scattered momentarily piece precious rock fell
suddenly squealing rush dozens black shadows flew frantically whirling flapping past
heart missed beat
bats disturbed sound
perhaps taken omen forces stone release
picked piece broken
stone cold smooth heavy
perfect flat edges
laid hand looked glowing crystal
fitted snugly palm
tell light chamber changing fading fast
placed hammer crystal bag closed securely turning make way back
excitement forgotten freezing water
legs numb feel feet barely move
moment passed panic thought stuck cave
great effort started walk like slow awkward automaton towards shore frank patiently waited
shouted companion take slack small voice died vastness great chamber
journey back frank standing took long time
legs getting warmer feel whole body shivering uncontrollably cold
suddenly shadow blocked shaft light cave pitched blackness
involuntarily looked window
light returned saw dislodged stone dust floating cave receding beams light
felt even deeper shiver pass

twenty feet edge pool disaster struck
couldnt feel feet missed footing completely plunging edge underwater shelf
lost balance fell headlong icy cold darkness
frank called harry
freezing liquid rushed mouth nose felt head plunge surface
shock coldness icy water filled head struck sharp rocky floor pool
frank struggled rope
first move
clambering edge pool free rope edge rocky shelf pull water
tremendous effort pulled edge
desperately dragged cold wet body water
frank knelt limbs shaking cold
wake
please wake heard frank say distance
voice seemed come nearer
became aware awakening though long deep dream
felt tired wanted pull bed covers go back sleep
cold head ached
world became clearer half darkness cave mystery
understand turned last looked fading shaft light high chamber
frank shouted feebly right
somehow thought frank trouble confusion soon gave way reality cold
raised slowly knees
frank supported struggled dress
felt nauseous strangely light headed
realisation accident subterranean lake infiltrated numbed head felt angry falling
shivering cold began subside covered every layer clothing
legs itched ached distressing sensation burning feeling returned
lifted packs slowly painfully retraced steps past silent witness skeleton cave entrance
every step head pounded pain shot legs
outside last blinked stupidly
frank stared head gasped
harry head
no dont touch
well clean later
gash skull left hair matted blood
cold shocked even felt
late afternoon sun felt warmth last something inside deliriously happy
help franks astonishment laughed aloud felt fresh new freedom enter heart
expedition succeeded
remember magical underground kingdom crystal light rest days
respected memory kept secret forever
exhilaration moment warmth sun relieved pain
frank tumbled scree landed rather ungainly fashion firm ground
no longer felt danger
adventure cave outside world seemed innocent homely
stood dusted
suddenly frank hissed pointed summit sgurr cavan
look
looked summit glimpsed silhouette man
standing darkly outlined horizon
tall figure wide brimmed hat
blinked looked gone

asked frank
follower

frank turned corner
years saw island
walked old flagstone path pushed half open stable door
strode kitchen
must looked sight
mother shrieked saw scolded laughed
told adventure left reference possible danger skeleton
scolded seemed satisfied cleaned bruised gashed head took away bedraggled clothes
hid precious white crystal went bed early
suddenly felt overwhelmingly tired
climbing stairs tumbled onto bed slept
came no surprise awoke severe chill remained bed nearly week
wild dreams infested fever later mother told babbled strange tales crystal lights caverns
smiled meekly said nothing
like leave crystal might found carried everywhere
kept small leather pouch pocket
spent hours gazing strange beautiful stone found
wondered unleash magical power thought possessed
sometimes crystal catch light reflect spectrum colour
sometimes found staring stone forgetting everything around
seemed drawn crystal like waking dream head filled strange words spoken unknown voice live stone world still apart life unknown earth heart
many long years ever mysterious traveller across deep sea
stand clear dawn master time enter caverns revealing crime
older history filled strange light touching cold mystery inside deep night
thoughts deeds vision sight
father told friend frank visited delirium say good bye family departed new house
saddened first broken friendship
thought might like father said handed wooden box

shuddered involuntarily put coat hat going quay see ferry come go
crystal pocket sat quayside
good weather passed overcast sky heavy rain
clouds darkened minute people went business grimly minding
sat buttoned jacket turned heavy leather pouch pocket
rain swept across sea obliterated view
stood walked shelter sea wall sat bench sheltering niche
weather hammered upon closed bringing thoughts mind mythras storm
loosened stone leather pouch held tightly hand
sharp hard crystal filled closed fist
recited strange words found front rev
finders journal like mantra words ran one another
ego sum dominus temporis ego sum dominus temporis ego sum dominus temporis ego sum dominus temporis heard words murmuring round inside head like sound chanting monks
found standing
know made wish upon stone walked slowly along sea wall ferry pier
ferry boarding passengers walking swiftly steps ticket office buy tickets board boat
stepped end line
rain streaming
pulse pounding ears approached boat yet nobody spoke
hear chant inside mind
walked ticket office stopped behind last passenger bought ticket
still no one stopped walked slowly booth onto boat
ticket inspector took ticket passenger passed tore two returned half
followed queue came inspector
took ticket man ahead approached turned aside shouted bridge

engines took new clamour deckhands began remove ropes holding gangway
heart leaping turned ran back gangway pier
complete lack shouts commotion unearthly
stood absolutely still boat pulled away
couldnt believe
somehow didnt know
something changed wasnt
watched great black crow flew circled head
involuntarily took old coin pocket looked
shone brightly dark sky
heard strange flapping saw brief darkness
put hand shield eyes huge crow swooped upon
great bird grasped coin wrenched fingers speeding away rain across sea
gasp stepped back edge wall let go stone pocket
feeling nauseous faint
perhaps still unwell
sat bench niche
opened eyes
felt strangely sleepy though awakening dream

old eric turned go
watched old sea dog walk along quay wind rain ran hill home
chapter four double cross ancient stalwart house massive castle
cold stone floors echoed sound thunder rumbling peals great rooms
torrential shower rain obscured view windows
high walls flared electric white lightning crackled past close
storm cut power grey monstrous building lay shadow
mullioned windows set high ground pierced stone walls
slate roofs stretched gloom
shaggy masses moss carpeted tiles old twining creepers fanned fingers across walls
outlines turrets towers half hidden mists streaming rain
eerie abode hugged lower slopes tree covered hillside foothills snowy mountains
range upon range ever higher hills precipice upon precipice piled behind
somewhere distance high snow covered peaks capped icy white even height summer
evening storm driven inland across plains rattling hills mark end long hot summer
water filled gullies smoothed cracked baked clay
tired streams began flow brown creamy frothing liquid
earth breathed sweet smell rain soaked soil smothered fields
around water released new perfumes pine woods wild herbs scented undergrowth
fungi mushroomed overnight woody tilth
creatures world took shelter woods hedges holes
violence opening scene gave way gentler play
new softer rain caressed countryside cooling feathery touch
life returned fields forests brown turned green
everywhere leaves dripping burnt umber parched earth received abundance heaving sighs gratitude
hill farmers farmhouses slept smiles upon faces dreams fixed plough tilled red ochre soil scythed lush grass ready changing year come
high hill electric light restored old house seemed cast softer shadow
no sinister murk adorned lofty towers
instead dull grey limestone friendly welcoming shower
ages time lay easily stones even builder intended twenty generations
hilly place source streams fed tributaries led rivers snaked plains
wild world still ruled shadows mountains
wolves roamed deep woods searching lost sheep
bears hunted sweet honey bees nests searched quiet caves winter sleep
rocks trembled time time sending avalanches scree washing valleys like dark chattering rivers stone
wilful rocks heaved mountain building continued
possible traverse inhospitable snowy mountains months summer
old drove road climbed great pass wound way tree line snaked high peaks air thin eagle flew alone sky
no towns people mountains
home ancient tribe hidden away remote valleys
people simple tough
farmed sheep goats hilly pastures tree line
shepherds brought sheep hills spring took back lower valleys late autumn approached
true people hills lived solitary almost silent lives
moved shelter shelter grazing sheep
shepherds rejoin families winter lived together small hamlets foothills
erebos large house built long ago rich city man lay edge one shepherd hamlets
summer palace escape
empty derelict many years place snakes bears found shelter
one day took interest man desire live apart men
old yet tired
traveller many years
felt need seek nature held power place close mountains felt something older man still controlled earth
eccentric man ignored shepherds time mild curiosity waned
people came know old man mountain true name sicarius known
needed name called wolfe
lived many years gathered herbs woods minerals valleys
walked hills made charts notes observed
curious man filled great house collections
service number short swarthy strangers arrived far away lands
spoke foreign tongue kept apart
every week cart brought supplies valley provide small household
small community survived unchanged many years
occasionally wolfe go away sometimes months house closed always returned
saw remarked never appeared older yet no one place age
seemed timeless man
bleak outward appearance house deceptive
principal rooms furnished comfortably tastefully obvious expense
suites rooms upper floors equally luxurious every modern contrivance available
many rooms available use yet remained empty mystery knew existence
wolfe ran estate methodical perfectionist zeal
maintained buildings land exceptional standard
within lower floors great house secrets known one
many crates packages filled storerooms vaults beneath main building
shelves lined walls rooms
rows carefully labelled boxes stacked ceiling high
labels written strange language coded complex numbers
concealed contained
meticulous collector kept doors rooms locked unless present
erebos foundations stone hills
behind doors deepest vault wide passageway led wall solid rock containing doorway
within stone arch door made material appearance stone smoothness glass
no handle lock apparent exterior surface door opened hidden mechanism
beyond door lay workings old mine
passageways hewn rock needed no support
old man spent many hours behind closed door depths hill

morning storm wolfe stood topmost tower great house looked across world
rain washed clean air given clarity crystal
horizon morning sun caught receding showers beneath arc rainbow
wolfe wore tattered cloak embroidered double cross
flowing white hair blew morning breeze old face looked troubled
seemed searching far horizon something
one hand held long staff capped silver held box
long time passed move stood silently watching waiting
solitary black speck appeared horizon moved swiftly towards tower
small black bird swept across skies grew great crow landed upon highest roof house
looked black eyes black beak old man
bird uttered single broken croak dropped something gleaming beak gathered flew back towards horizon
wolfe turned go walked stairway
went spoke quietly strong steady voice
time come last strided stairs
days followed house became place great activity
servants prepared guest rooms
folded stowed dust sheets
transports arrived carrying supplies food drink
small household expanded arrival dozen new helpers appeared countrymen existing staff
staff never talked working
remained mute evening hot kitchens babbled together strange tongue
clear house prepared number guests old man seen
made way smooth stone door old mines
far house hillside acrid smoke rose unseen fissures
ready old man stood courtyard first light welcomed guests
one journeyed separately
arrived foot forests hills
travelled great distance appeared dishevelled shepherds wearing old grey cloaks tough leather jerkins
wolfe stood gate first approached
welcome said outstretched arm indeed good see long time
come
first arrive
wolfe replied guest firmly shaking hand long journey pleased last
six
five came intervals day slipped quietly gates
one arrived dead night old man stood waiting ancient porch
greeted traveller fashion neither equal yet superior one stood apart civil host
servants escorted quarters
night torch blazed door old man waited patiently one never come
wolfe guests assembled dining hall midday meal
one week rains begun
scene magnificent
pale light filtered stained glass windows spread coloured patterns across table set banquet
servants carried beautifully prepared dishes kitchens
waiters dressed handsome livery blue silver served meal
six guests sat opposite three row old man occupied head table
empty place laid foot table
guests no longer wore country clothes dressed striking garments
one different colour design
appeared like uniforms generals former generations embroidered waistcoats coloured sashes
six transformed unkempt hair unshaven faces emerge strong sophisticated yet wise men lords double cross
ancient order usually eschewed excess finery favour research philosophy
occasionally met formal guise pursued work elders
colour garments matched titles lords blue lord truth red lord knowledge emerald lord friendship purple lord destiny violet lord faith gold lord freedom
wolfe wore white also dressed lord white lord reason
one company mythras lord mystery no colour
together made strength eight lords double cross
came far wide across land across sea like wolfe studied deeper arts life nature
meal extended afternoon much conversation travels exploits distant places
although rarely met together company seemed ease hearty withdrew parlour close
indulged beverages made herbs fruits mountains enhanced spices distant lands
usually silent old man host become animated lively
long time passed convivial conversation old man stood glass hand spoke
friends asked purpose mind voice became serious slow
time act
fear white crystal found
assembled six attended earnestly old man continued
know one holds knowledge fact white crystal no longer legend
purveyors magic suspicion
yet seems science thing acts magic
beyond understanding dangerous thing
one crystal undoubtedly believes magic undoubtedly thinks master
tried magic succeeded others failed
thinks discovered secret stone
leave use power alone voice rose spoke
dangerous
must bring white crystal must safe guarded
nobody else may know thing balance world surely undone
thundered
company murmured together uneasily
six lords looked towards silent companion stood quiet grim contemplation
white lord continued know live place time
mythras need guidance mystery
blue lord stepped forward spoke deep measured voice
news bring council elders
mythras dead elders elected wish white lord lord reason take place mythras lord mystery day
bring token office
blue lord stood back line others waited wolfe speak
things come lifetime
elders wisdom chosen wisely
accept office moment
tell wolfe returns thanks take token office safe keeping
mythras dead yet lives
blue lord handed small wooden box symbol double cross inlaid lid
wolfe held box spoke issue first order new authority
must take matter forward
must prepare journey
go rooms meet together one hour chamber moon
appointed time seven gathered small chamber high tower
no ordinary room painted deep blue wide windows seven eight walls
sat around old octagonal table wolfe spoke
tell something history behind thing said may decide path future
long ago council elders appointed one mythras worthy
necromancer wise within rotten ambition
man become mythras virtue great knowledge mysteries undoubted also claimed found new science secret temporal change
simply put power time
council elders foresaw indeed control time also powerful possibly dangerous
appointed mythras order bound rule lords double cross always serve preserve good world
devised strength eight ensure others always aware mythras activities
no certainty whether mysteries claimed mythras true records showed thought unlikely magicians trick
council also saw power mythras claimed used good well evil true desired use science ends
council commanded lords double cross watch mythras discover possess secret insisted
mythras determined science illusion temporal change particular material manufactured create effect desired
think correct
however although knew formula magic possess substance
journeyed known world tested every material find
built laboratory tried create perfect substance raw materials around
used cauldrons molten lava collected active volcanoes distilled pure substances precious stones no avail
science world many centuries behind thought attempts synthesise substance vain
exactly mean temporal change
asked blue lord
know sure effect change pace time
clocks made work forwards backwards
may seemed trick first experienced effect proved real unbalancing
events many things become possible
seemingly impossible attained
replied wolfe
tremor excitement usually controlled voice
man ever succeed quest
asked gold lord
always believed although never proven thus dilemma
accounts travelling magician accounts handed many generations no doubt much altered embroidered across years
pioneer many pioneers perished hands science
indeed succeed may entered impossible circumstance perished
necessarily worked alone
claimed material required specialised crystal kind timing master synthesised earthly materials
gave no hint might found
days use quartz crystals regulate time maybe clue
fell favour
council elders eventually stripped man office
records show council felt achieve claim time outcast charlatan
man went journeying became travelling magician little entertainer
however council trust always sent follower wisely turned
many years passed travelling magician eventually went island named suidhe coast big city disappeared
never appear
blue lord questioned
magician never appeared guise
years later old wealthy man died mainland
amongst possessions many gathered known world world known house
left leader council elders
still exists seen
paragraph relating house note attached addressed specifically council stated rambling fashion house contained thing council looked years
short inferred magic crystal
magic stone found asked emerald lord believe fallen hands
stolen
no
white crystal never found house
never possession believe thing thought
indeed according one white crystal eight one
many years searched white crystals knowledge power supposedly possess
failed also tried find formula material question
seems however ability explicate science contained stones died old man
lifetime search research failed reveal method temporal change
illogical
much seems illogical found nature
understand appears magic
forbears no understanding electricity lightning magnetism elements science
explained myths imagination
whole religions devised explain circumstances world place within
knowledge hard shift legend mistaken truth
prefer fact research understanding science
know magician make crystals found
magician find white crystal
asked red lord
know certainty replied wolfe
believe crystals found somewhere suidhe magician disappeared
indeed believe key disappearance
alas despite many enquiries searches island never found source indeed one
looked
history days become legend unreliable
clues might led place lost destroyed great storm
great war led many years darkness elders obliged move attentions elsewhere
makes sure white crystal found
questioned gold lord
still one man island remembers something elder days helps time time replied wolfe
tells boy island made discovery recently
believes discovery crystal
boy stays island sure controlling thing
short journey big city
teenage boy vulnerable many temptations
must find boy quickly sure safety know others world ambitions power wish find
gold lord looked
others
asked
inferred people strong strange belief
fanatic claim things
dangerous evasive
descended original follower sent council
white crystal found must determine whence came protect sake future generations
must protect boy keep others bay
ancient modern play upon fields time unless much mistaken
saying wolfe turned gold lord gave papers tied scroll
maps papers help find boy island
must leave first light seek
choose one accompany make preparations
gold lord chose take emerald lord mission
left room returned chambers night
violet lord purple lord return council elders inform come pass day
also inform council take action safeguard secrets known
must protect people
danger boy secure
without speaking purple lord violet lord turned together prepared leave great house
within hour two men appeared courtyard
dressed grey brown coats dark leather hats
pass common travellers
walked gates turned path separated
soon vanished mists hung hazy vaporous curtains across valleys
one duty said wolfe perhaps dangerous duty perform
turned remaining two lords looked silently moment
duty
asked red lord
must go find others spoke replied wolfe
others also seek white crystal
easy wish alert
ruthless men
look three
two paid thugs third key
harder find
think yet know concerns know boy
informants sure looking person
must go divert gaze time secure future
willing
ready lords replied
wolfe
white lord
mythras
remain tasks perform
far omens good thank saying wolfe placed hands shoulders men turned left room
night passed sun cast first shadows day red lord blue lord left house
slipped silently away unseen woods going way towards future
travel place powers lived big city
left wolfe bade farewell gave small book verses
often order words provided solutions else fails
lines use times trouble come elder days said
read
old man mountain wolfe white lord reason become mythras lord mystery stood steeped thought silence
companions left went library consulted many old books making notes drawing diagrams
finished tasks took refreshment walked cellars approached stone door
door swung open within dark passages coolness filtered
wolfe entered tunnel door closed behind
turned string lights illuminated long narrow passageway mountain
old man strode forward short distance passageway curved sharply right downhill
sense direction soon lost tunnel spiralled deeper
coolness upper galleries gave way acrid uncomfortable smell pervaded everywhere
rock walls changed colour light brown grey metallic deep magenta
wolfe walked steadily footsteps echoing descended
another noise slowly became louder
deep muffled pumping sound
passage time dropped far base mountain spiral tunnel eventually ended second door
door opened ahead old man entered cavern
livid red glow leapt within
chamber deep slow pulse pervasive coupled high hiss escaping steam sounded like giant slow steam engine
wolfe moved forward across sweltering space
size shape small ship
smell sulphur hung air small clouds steam issued vaporously hidden vents
cavern empty lay irregular masses globular rock
one side pipes presses chimneys workbenches gathered around laboratory
places great rock pillars stretched roof ledges platforms jutted walls centre monstrous pit
fissure red glow emerged point wolfe threaded way
centre cavern intensely hot
wolfe reached edge chasm stood high rock carved look like giant lectern overhung cauldron
looked opening
glare molten rock reflected white robes
reason house built mountain
forge first owner hoped yield magic temporal change heat strength melt rock totally destroy make anew
tumult within furnace loud molten rock boiling leaping crashing back crusty red surface
wolfe noted lava active seen active
turned leave no experiments day
swiftly made way back across chamber door
door closing heard felt blast explosion within chamber
dropped floor mighty rock door slammed shut behind
beneath feet felt faint tremor rock first time life wolfe scared
powerful man amongst men powers contained within earth men insignificant
substance rock energy core planet part greater scheme things part cosmos
quickly wolfe returned along passageway house sealed great stone door
outside stopped drew breath
even earth seemed sense time change hand
no tremors day wolfe contented planning future
future moment seemed uncertain thought six wise lords moving towards allotted places filled mind hope
wolfe sat library surrounded shelves ancient books
two cats one black one white lay curled chairs one end room
table beside well thumbed volume
hand written journal
opened marked page read words
day come mythras return
many signs portend day
look

closed book said mythras ancient fool
picked small wooden box received elders double cross upon investiture

inevitable come pass future even drawing near
time come patience years waiting watching rewarded
picked coin table looked closely

chapter five big city clock ticked loudly room
went bed sleep
threw bedclothes lay staring wide eyed darkness
got paced room
often went window looked across sea towards mainland
opened window wider try catch breeze air still heavy
storm rising distance rain soon coming
clouds veiled far away coast wanted see
three times went bed three times rose
felt excited
feeling inside never experienced half nervous tension strange smiling power deep within made tremble exhilaration
imagined walking water sea mainland
time appeared stopped night walked around small room
clock moved slowly
mind racing thoughts flashed head even lightning distant rumble filtered window
curtains fluttered breeze heralded storm come
tense clouds seemed infiltrate feelings flash decided go
went cupboard pulled old duffel bag
stopped take
minutes filled warm clothes drawer biscuits kitchen
first drops heavy rain sputtered onto glass crept silently back room
went bed fourth time night
sound thunder reverberated ears listen
felt satisfied calm time slept
awoke five oclock morning
air clear everything outside heavy nights rain
excited scared determined go plan
day third september saturday morning
boat less crowded weekend thought
quickly quietly dressed put money much wallet collected things
wrote quick note father gone adventure back bedtime placed mantelpiece dining room going quietly back upstairs
crept window jumped rocky bank behind house landed silently soggy wet moss
knew no one else awake see
early morning outside cool fresh beautiful
dawn rising clouds rosy horizon walked swiftly deserted street
harbour still empty quiet
almost high tide full grey sea rolling slowly along base harbour wall
gulls rode lazily waves flotilla grey white black marble eyes watched passed
old harbour walls built boulders rough hewn stone sat squat heavy strong
know going sure something get mainland
found place hide away one niches settled wait
determined hold white crystal needed board boat
confident succeed
fresh banks clouds slid silently across dome sky shut beautiful delicate pale blue
new morning replaced old grey damp hint autumn air carried cooling breeze
peace island around sat stony alcove beneath harbour wall
looking listened quiet except slow slosh sea sound wind ears
excitement danger felt woke dissipated place felt calm even happy
realised sitting determined leave island true home good place live
felt emotion belonging holding island like strange magnetism
hour passed time harbour slowly came life
men came work
hear familiar voices prepared landing stage ferry
across waves yet unseen boat approaching mainland
one men saw sitting wall waved
part scenery people expected
waved back hand pocket fingered pouch holding precious stone
continued vigil distance caught sight solitary figure
standing close empty old house perches cliffs high hill far side harbour
stood still looking boats wondered
looking
looked sea saw ferry come view harbour entrance
rusty black hull ploughed water leaving white foamy wash rippling across slow murky waves
black exhaust stained air short stubby red funnel captain manoeuvred vessel channel swinging buoys
thrubbing ferrys engines grew louder small ship rounded harbour wall drew alongside quay
engines revved roughly reverse water surged around hull
men called secured ropes bollards quayside
gently boat eased rest engines stopped harbour quiet
saturday rest day trickle passengers crossed ferry landing stage
counted six men
dock workers busy hour afterwards unloading grey sacks post pallets cargo onto waiting trailers
hold empty began stow boat crates fish farm produce parcels destined big city
weather turned foul dark clouds blanketed sky repressive gloom
rain poured punctuated sound thunder rolling across sea
handful passengers arrived board ferry stood sheltering teeming rain small shelter dock
recognised took care remain sight
waited crew raised boarding sign first passengers went small wooden ticket office gangway onto deck
quayside almost deserted
incessant rain swept squally pulses across docks
shelter alcove ineffectual soon dripping cold
see crew passengers looking boat
get board act
slipped crystal leather pouch palm hand
repeated spell
ego sum dominus temporis
three times said strange sleepy drugged feeling came
picked duffel bag moved gloom day
feel brow prickly flushed sweat stepped quayside
trembling walked towards ticket office
hail rain poured torrents
sky mass dark boiling cloud
strangely dark even stormy day
reached spot yards barrier
stopped
move
thunder around town
final passenger already boarded ahead
head felt heavy looking see several passengers crew looking straight
nerve shattered
shivering turn run away
suddenly rending explosion
air crackled white heat lightning struck
air filled steam
deaf
blind
feel whole body vibrate hum
think may screamed
head pounded
overtaken dark panic thought left ran ran straight ahead
vision returned
see shadows rushed towards vessel
distant muffled sound echoed ears
someone deck shouting
people saloon crowded round windows looking standing seconds
ran straight past ticket office two officers ship crashed gangway quay
stop
ran deck hoarse shivering shock
rain streamed face filled eyes
alone
shaking hands barely grip deck rail turned looked back quayside
two ships officers bending something quay others running across town
looked like body lying ground
long time nothing happened
men stood away earnestly talking stared gloom
two officers returned slowly towards ferry people came town
another flash lightning drew eyes hills sharp silhouette figure stood storm
shrank back gangway deck shelter amongst ropes canvas
suddenly felt impossibly tired
sat old tarpaulin closed eyes
first opened eyes panicked
nowhere
everything white
perhaps dead
no boat ferry
sat
right
stiff cold crawled hiding place
clouds encircled boat everything seemed close vague fog
wet murky dream world reality disappeared
felt completely alone sounds muffled grumble engines screeching gulls
visibility reduced feet strange white light enveloped everything
fog curtailed senses began wonder boarded ghost ship
ghost board
head hurt terribly felt nauseous
press back hiding place sit shivering
every minutes caught muttering ego sum dominus temporis
embracing clouds clung clammy tenacity
senses afloat
references gone
eerie echoing unseen gulls followed boat like aerial spirits crying wind
tell hearing right wrong
time seemed telescope white world
terrible moment thought back quay
reflected events hour
really
white crystal done back
body quay

moment panicked
head clearing white light getting brighter around
matter
ferry big city
change came suddenly fog bank billowed away behind ferry emerged bright sunshine
contrast unnerving
blinds lifted eyes ears no longer deaf
monochrome world burst brilliant life
clear space filled mind colour soaked eyes sky sapphire blue sea aquamarine
sun already warming face
space minute whole world changed completely
aching head cleared miraculously fresh new confidence
bright morning light made squint blink
looked around across sparkling waves place never really seen
ferry less mile big city harbour
buildings towered skyline
glass walls reflected sky dazzling display jet emerald
peak upon peak mountainous sky scrapers ranged back heart city
closer harbour alive vessels arriving leaving
derricks cranes lined docksides
ships massive bulk wallowed wharves waiting cranes disgorge treasured cargoes
pleasure boats yachts skimmed across waters criss crossing harbour marina forests masts rigging slapping lay tangled morning sky
two dolphins arced dove alongside ferry
sleek bodies dazzled brilliant display playful mastery sea
thought world seemed wear fresh happy smile moment new pleasure
bold bright buildings grew magnificence stature ferry closed terminus
cars trucks freeways gleamed processed ceaseless multitude across six lane deck suspension bridge
rose curved across harbour entrance single perfect majestic span imitating dolphins raced
far see smoky stacks factories distant glint metalwork strung webbing silver pipes
chimneys like great twisted candles spouted yellow red white smoke sky
giant cylindrical tanks sprawled sea
knew talks frank edifice great bay oil refinery
watched things sense awe wonder ferry came dock
like stepping forward time
realised suidhe old also old fashioned
island formed different era history ferry like time machine future sea
closer boat came shore less overall picture see clearer detail became
like huge jigsaw hundreds pieces formed every part
hum city came across water like sound hive
engine oil sulphur smarted sense smell
sound engines thrummed ears gleam steel glared eyes
things tantalised senses new delights
even fresh warmth sun appeared increase close dry heat came near city
glistening green black glass terminal building lay welcome like vast iridescent beetle
passengers came onto deck ferry stood small group around gangway chatting together others quietly watching
no one noticed silently waiting place stern
wasnt
boat docked smoothly calmly precision born confidence regularity
gangway dropped engaged terminus walkway ferry engines slowed idle
watched passengers walk casually gaping hall building away
seemed disappear vastness place
no one watching ferry seemed least interested
got
time felt steady clear headed
walked round deck gangway across walkway building
didnt look either side went
strangely feel nervous
sure fine
shining stone floor seemed doubly solid still gently rolling deck ferry
no ticket collectors empty booths walked
arrived big city
walked centre great hall stood gazed
looked around across
place unlike anything seen
kiosks benches lined walls lights reflected marble floors
nothing appeared support glinting glass roof magic
pigeons fluttered artificial sky others ambled lamely smooth ground pecking picking small item food
place universe
nameless music echoed reverberated occasionally punctuated unintelligible announcement spoken robotic female voice
voice emanated nowhere spoke no one people ignored
arrays giant lights spread artificial daylight thin air inside despite sun blazed blue sky
building appeared contrived artificial yet magnificent place like modern palace
notice people first around kiosks within waiting rooms sat men women boys girls
seemed insignificant vast hall
knew ships went coast across ocean
traffic saturday light still early
many people silent statues almost nothing
read newspapers hiding behind broadsheets looked ground seemingly deep thought stared vacantly glazed eyes waited passing time
cleaner walked lazily past pushing giant broom meandering across floor whistling went
two old men scruffily dressed shuffled across rubbish bin rummaged detritus inside
walked disappointed mumbled incoherently
rolled coat lying black formless ragged bench contained man asleep
big city people silent grey inanimate
thought
grim mouths empty eyes
watched yawning waiting numbers clock clicked interminably
heart cheered saw large smiling woman dressed apron cap
leaning across clean metal counter kiosk talked flamboyant gestures old grey man sitting stool drinking tea
itll lead no good see right saying man appeared ignore
cleaner walked interrupted harangue
ivy give tea luv sat another stool rested elbows bar top
realised hungry walked towards kiosk see snack buy
save rest biscuits later
reached place remembered crystal
hand time
even thought arose mind voice close behind called
turned involuntarily
yea
come ere
stood staring two young men black jackets black shiny hair black glasses blue jeans
almost carbon copies difference size comical
lean tall one spoken
thoughts magic instantly left slipped crystal hand leather pouch
remembered old eric told magic mainland
old eric seemed different world
must known thought
two sinister young men leaning steel railing beside escalator flowed sight
short fat one chewed grinned man beckoned across
like look either walked anyway
fat man spat gum mouth asked come
answer fat man started walk signalling follow
obediently followed man walked behind
suidhe island replied fat one laughed vicious scathing cackle
men kept walking
felt almost imperceptible movement beside fat one pointed something towards roof said look
stopped looked
followed pointing finger someone patted back
ivy kiosk looked three shouted hey leave hes kid
heard slight noise behind turned look thin man gone turned back way fat man disappearing escalator side hall
went kiosk
ivy cleaner looked sadly
wan keep away likes dear said ivy
theyll clean no time
mean
asked looked shook heads
asked cup tea biscuit felt pocket wallet gone
turned red embarrassment anger easily duped early day
no one ever told thieves didnt island

tea cake welcome ivy said
take advice go home something serious happens
couldnt imagine serious thanked drank tea left
checked pocket crystal still leather pouch sighed relief
although found promising start adventure decided time see city
franks new address piece paper intended make way destination
city one day catch evening ferry home survive without little money brought
two thieves disappointed counted haul
found way exit strode automatic glass doors onto pavement busy road alongside huge car park
weather changing sun invisible behind mounting grey clouds day still fair
parked taxis cars lined roadway
see bus station across way large yellow buses parked neatly beside shelters
bus different number name destination board
noise smell vehicles engulfed
felt walked monstrous mechanical farmyard
place squalid empty cans cigarette ends squashed packaging lay abandoned grimy pavements
despite constant arrival departure many vehicles struck people seemed going anywhere anything particular
everybody outside waited within
pavements beyond terminus seemed deserted
nobody walked big city everyone went car taxi bus
taken bus city centre without money no choice walk
started walking along road past bus station towards centre city
road built along top old stone causeway wide enough two lanes vehicles direction
fuming snake traffic crawling along towards distant junction freeway
walked past cars buses lorries looking one turn taking
never seen many vehicles one place even pictures
engines rattled whined brakes hissed squeaked
every minutes whole parade vehicles surge forward engines revving opening like giant concertina collapse squealing hissing tight stop
drivers vehicles leaned windows clutched wheels stared mirrors talked
oblivious world outside except vehicle front
occasionally irate horn blare someone shout although seemed no reason
freeway junction different
wider terminus road traffic never stopped raced past unceasingly pace barely distinguish vehicles one another
three lanes traffic flowed way rattling roaring stampede
pavement stopped abruptly junction nowhere go
stood front snarling morass traffic blinked stupidly glaring light wondered next
knew city centre lay beyond direction first started walk
see shining towers horizon impenetrable wall moving vehicles barring way
deep ditch wild terrain empty marshland lay either side road
bricks rubble erupted green slimy water muddy puddles
occasional half dead bush reed covered patch grew stubbornly desolation
uninviting place wilderness spread distance
green soupy water smelled decay surface buzzed angrily hordes insects
gas bubbles glooped surface dragonflies dipped danced air
looked frantic freeway turned away
seemed no alternative walk back way come
retraced steps surprise saw man grey coat wide brimmed hat standing path looking across wasteland
hurried past dark figure without looking
minutes later stood outside ferry terminus
looked back road saw two cars stop waiting man get first sped towards city
watched two men walked along road place man stood looking back towards
wore smart grey business suits
one red tie one blue
looked around different way go
one road slipped quietly away towards docks
no cars travelling train like parade parked lorries lined one side
followed road no footpath corner terminus building
turned first one way zig zagging large formless warehouses
main road numerous spurs led warehouses yards
occasionally lorry thunder past vibrating ground weight sped
see far direction towering warehouses around able make steady progress along road
dusty tarmac shady quiet footfall echoed featureless walls
although didnt appear signs clues direction guessed making way circuitous route toward city centre
stopped suddenly tie shoe lace distant hum traffic hear sound steps behind stopping
looked see no one
distance big city thing illusion
distance appears short seen start becomes progressively longer make way
docklands walking
try walking big city aware big
scale things quite wrong mere humans
land giants mechanical giants
aware available time passing quickly didnt seem getting closer destination
cursed thieves stolen money began despair ever seeing city centre
thought asking someone help no one ask place deserted except footpad still following
wary feeling growing inside
went around one right angled bend finally came across something different
felt cheered sight
ship
largest thing ever seen
even distance impressive vast black bulk filled quayside
approached monster open mouthed stood twenty feet away
deck high roof warehouse building
bridge rear vessel rose high
massive red funnel
hawsers thick mans body spiralled quayside close stood
turned towards city saw solitary man grey coat leaning gantry distance
face hidden shadows cast broad brim hat
appeared looking sea
man
decided speak satisfy curiosity
tall bird like cranes travelled rails length docks unloading ships
walked past vessels slow moving train overtook hooting approached
two dirty industrial engines pulling perhaps hundred wagons rumbled clanked clattered way towards end quay
grey man close side railway waited train pass
last wagon rolled away crossed lines man place empty no one visible
eternal spying eyes gulls wheeled air
uniform grey mass cloud covered sky every direction small cool breeze stirring ruffling tops murky green waves bay
rain drifted across drizzled mist blowing wind
heavier drops followed steady patter soon turned dusty road gleaming black lake
put hood huddled along faster
walked looked place cover stop let shower pass
splashed way side road relative shelter open warehouse loading bay sat deserted concrete plinth
took food munched way thoughtfully biscuits
carefully preserved later
great disappointment sky darkened still rain hailed gusto
avoid soaking stood backed shadows loading bay
rain descended like curtain across entrance way
stopped watched listening drumming rattle iron roof
noisy darkness heard another sound whistle
suddenly periphery vision shadows emerged gloom either side
tensed froze
seconds later six youths surrounded
remained silent watching
one stepped forward tall lad long unkempt hair
noticed wore worn brown leather boots faded sleeveless denim jacket
turned trousers short thin age
lad strong tattooed arms small podgy hands
one hand three fingers stabbed air front

saw looking around ferry terminal
stepped back dark
time go
back way
take star chamber ordered tuffy
found dragged away instant
jostled along running pace long wet deserted alleys amidst buildings
twisting turning lost sense direction
tuffy lead disappeared unseen doorway followed dark passageway long flights steps
footsteps echoed no sound
passageway went long lightless slope ended heavy door
door opened smoothly company entered chamber
behind door clanged shut sound like deep metallic gong
pitch black see nothing
suddenly silence ping brilliant light illuminated strangest places
blinked harsh brightness looked around
big city gang still surrounded seemed relaxed
clearly arrived star chamber
room large circular brick lined chamber high domed roof
six doors around circumference chamber identical shut one entered didnt know one
large old wooden table number chairs no two alike standing threadbare circular rug
stately chandelier place palace hanging centre room
fixed old hook rusty iron chain
light device sparkled rebounded equally dramatic ceiling
ornate brightly painted scene clouds cherubs centre magnificent chasm surrounded trumpeting angels covered dome
whole effect dramatic unnerving
tuffy gang already seated waved seat amongst
looked around companions luxurious light able see first time
different chairs occupied
tuffy tall arrogant leader exuded calm control
street wise dress seemed faded magnificent chamber sat like king amongst knights
filled elegant cut glass goblets wine earthenware decanter handed around
received glass
muffy sat right hand leader
maintained constant sneer otherwise indistinct face
clothes mimicked tuffy failed ill fit muffys physical demeanour succeed exerting anything comical expression ineptitude
muffy none tuffys lean gaunt sharp style comfortable fireside physique little overweight little short stature little grey pallor ordinary youth
puffy occupied chair side tuffy
puffy huge girth perched rather sat chair wide fit
inconsiderable height seemed diminished weight
schoolboy face adorned pair broken horn rimmed spectacles

completely bald head often covered massive white stetson hat dominated whole appearance
put hat beside table
next chair contained huffy whose purpose seemed exaggerate size companion
huffy tiny like jockey
stood five feet tall bony sallow youth
clothes several sizes large
wore black suit tie pallid appearance undertakers assistant
sat hunched glass holding stem hands curled around like claws
scrawny neck emerged turtle like shiny jacket badly broken nose gave face beak like quality
vulturish creature scowled across table without blinking whilst constantly muttering oaths
duffy sat opposite leader
dressed like farm boy check shirt jeans
arms legs seemed proportion body reached awkwardly clothes
small eyes large mouth seemed permanently surprised
sat hands pockets chewed gum whilst pushing back chair onto spindly hind legs large limbs splayed front
noticed spoke no one frequently laughed making sound like braying donkey
last chair bar stool perched crystal
seemed quite place company yet also seemed occupy special position
first impression girl
wore black leather jacket loose jeans
sat legs apart elbows table toying small length knotted rope
dishevelled red hair hung limp strands across face
closer inspection possible view beneath tawny shadows see clear grey eyes smooth creamy freckled skin distinctive girls face
everyone received wine company stood raised goblets
tuffy sang big city gang reply came others big city gang
shout echoed domed roof rang around chamber like bell sounding
everyone sat except leader looked gleam eye
welcome star chamber harry
shouted everyone laughed
looked sheepishly reply

silence moment crystal began sing
voice filled dark space slow haunting liquid clear beautiful sound
words song hovered dreamily air
magic journey changed life
waters run silent dark
deeper blackness falls time lost destiny invisible calls
freedom flows towards sea forever moving mountains far still call icy crown
tongues liquid moving thought like flames flicker tunnels meanings sought question true
listen filled hope fear pass night morning brings answer clear dawning new light
star chamber empty returned one one gang entered various doors surrounded
tuffy waited present set trot rest followed
middle group huffy ran close behind
journey surface brisk uneventful

flooded long time ago biggest port coast huffy went mechanical drone voice walked towards city centre
changed direction often avoid detection grey followers
still felt lost occasional glimpses buildings confirmed getting closer city centre
walk town took long time
much realised
appearance surrounding buildings changed moved
warehouse district gave way factory district factory district gave way shopping district
encountered hardly people walking shopping district found another world
never seen many people many shops
great car parks edge occupied rows rows shiny cars
whole thing resembled layer beehive cars buzzing manoeuvring constant motion
beyond car parks distance shopping halls glass marble palaces filled moving stairways lifts cascades plants waterfalls
plate glass windows dozens gift clothing shops ranged along walls halls
squares roofs held cafs restaurants shoppers sat idly chatting passing day
sugary music drifted air hubbub people sliding feet shiny marble floors
colours bright exciting displays full exotic

next district entered housing district consisted rows identical terraced houses interspersed numerous high rise apartment blocks
streets around tenements shabby everything appeared worn
east housing said huffy

around streets children roamed gangs played football
young mothers seen keeping eye open windows front doors
roads houses extended distance ceased abruptly entered office district

many high towers stood sentinel along roads dark weekend
people seen security guards eyed suspiciously walked returned outpost boxes passed
went old shopping district
real old city said huffy

nobs come ere stuff faces
sometimes come ere night work round clubs
always money made drunks
saturday afternoon place quiet
roads area small old fashioned buildings quaint decorative
every old shop seemed club restaurant
theatres
behind buildings grubby back alleys empty crates huge overflowing bins
huffy sometimes took short cuts back yards
stopped open door leading grubby kitchen
huffy poked head rough voice inside called

huffy returned sullen muttering

walked government district
completely different character contained massive stone buildings large enough giants
everything buildings larger reality

stood edge grass behind row tall grey plane trees looked across expanse park
people walked shadows ones twos sat benches
solitary horseman cantering across grass towards tree lined dell distance
huffy started walking across grass casual circuitous route followed
quarter hour later entered ring trees growing around lip former clay pit
saw horseman still mounted foot hill looking interest
huffy ran slope centre dell followed
approached realised horseman crystal
looked quite different saddle
seated proud mount thought looked heroic
shadows appeared around banks long entire big city gang standing together group
light fading evening shadows fallen across old clay pit leaving group well hidden
looked thought saw silhouette man standing edge looking
no grey shadow fleetingly standing tree
blinked looked apparition gone
thought mentioning others fled tuffy started lay plan nights adventures
comrades friends began quiet voice come district one borrow money
first thought going rob bank different plan afoot tuffy continued big city hotel casino roof big money won lost

duffy shone small torch saw drain no water directly appeared entrance form underground tank
came long wait
started speak often
asked crystals horse raised head listening intently
shh whispered crystal slipped tree stump handing pegasus reins

never spoke anyone simply smiled looked
crystal pegasus reappeared quietly gone angry heard approaching
gently slowly came bank opposite direction

duffy untied bags hanging saddle horse tied length rope
together dropped rope bag bag edge manhole took strain six bulging pillowcases duffy tied rope top rung iron ladder descended darkness

held rider around waist firmly first decreasing tension journey progressed
came fence tense moment wondered horse try jump instead found broken railings fallen tree
horse picked way across onto path beyond
journey back star chamber one strangest ever known
horse night time city seemed incongruous also magical
many people stared passed roads
distance behind heard sirens commotion guessed crime discovered
crystal expert piloting beast streets relatively quiet mid evening lull
closed eyes imagined travelling city ancient times
horses hooves striking road regular clip clop metal stone sound echoed walls passed
travelled back roads footpaths way crossing larger roads time time

crystals voice quiet firm
made mind mine
crystal seemed quiet contemplative progressed without word passing
felt enraptured wonder city night
lights thousands houses apartments concealed hundreds thousands lives moving together like myriad parts gigantic organism
distance see elevated freeway seemed lights cars pulsed along like lifeblood city roads like arteries
turned small road car turned behind
suddenly car raced past
feel horse tense beneath
whoa boy crystal leaned stroked beasts neck
car squealed stop ahead second car came slowly behind
trap

two cars completely blocking street

crystal handed man packet whispered something pointing wound hind quarter
old man ran hands
turned without word still glancing unsympathetically towards
man led animal inside crystal turned towards pointed road follow
evening wearing still miles destination walked quickly
crystal seemed busy thoughts remained silent talk follower made wary looked shadows every junction
mile passed quiet lonely world shopping district night
contrast bright family filled shops day night time squalor startling
dark doorways home drunks dropouts runaways muttered oaths shrank back shadows passed
crystal ignored found repulsive filled danger
dirty men unintelligible slurs waved bottles asked money sinister silent black shapes stayed huddled beneath old coats dark squalid corners
people live
asked

walked trying look aside went
saw shadow emerge doorway ahead stand darkness
crystal must seen quickly crossed road moved hurriedly way
shadow figure turned watched went past
crystal walked briskly towards main square ahead light
glanced behind saw figure walking swiftly along opposite pavement
follower
whispered
no think
something else dont like

well alone
stick close behind go exactly go replied breathlessly increased pace
minute later darted small passageway ramp empty car park
car park cavernous filled rows pillars walls ramps lift shafts
handful cars
dodged around different levels stealthily quietly crystal motioned stop
crouched beside parapet view entrance
presently dark shadow crossed threshold entered building
looked stood still seemed long time
light building sparse caught glimpse eyes looked towards
terrified seen felt compelled stand

package contained money casino raid
tuffy wanted make sure news got back big city gang planned robbery
distance figure stood alone watching end street
jogged 7th district deserted factories
high spirits infectious long gang song ringing warehouse walls
singing died silence approached labyrinth tunnels stream shadows slipped unseen hide secured doors behind
entered star chamber feasted hour
gang told tales exploits
even told ride home shadowy figures seen
crystal alone quiet
time went found couldnt help looking

crystal pushed back hair first time minutes really see face
eyes shining damp
perhaps little slow little dense sometimes
perhaps experience new
stood stupidly blinking floor
crystal reached hand put shoulder
stood looking straight downcast eyes
help look meet questioning eyes
moment no choice knew won
nodded assent
beaming smile face total amazement hugged walked elated twisting passages
began recognise places passed earlier day time reached heavy bulkhead door realised crystal meant escape along old underground river
opened door went
saw water canoe left
heaved heavy door shut turned bolt
pitch black within sound water loud close deep dark surrounding
well right canoe must without lights said crystal
tuffy turns bed time
added
still carrying duffel bag left fear losing triumphantly pulled small torch one taken sgurr cavan
even torch getting canoe performance
soon ready cast
new adventure begun
river flowed made steady slow progress upstream
used torch sparingly show way ahead
hard keep scraping slimy walls
travelling city uncharted waters ancient secret river
went darkness towards freedom
splash paddles echoed roof
water flowed almost silently slender craft moved
passed unseen openings felt darkness
streams entered weirs poured water unknown places
must hundreds tunnels drains
evidence around showed craftsmen built
millions bricks lined tunnels arches
twice glimpsed light street lights shone cracks distant drain high river secret world
belonged night
must follow river right across city marsh
stick take way home
way small job
crystal sounded little different new assertiveness tone
leader gang
several hours passed felt tired
sound water rhythm paddling lulling dreamy wakefulness
suddenly crystal lifted paddle aboard pulled canoe small landing stage
shine torch said excited voice
pointed beam towards slanting shaft dropped darkness within see quite clearly form six white pillowcases tied rope hanging rusty ladder
chapter seven secret river scrambled sloping culvert
pillowcases hanging dark
old iron ladder broken sufficient remained provide footrest
last cases dangled almost reach stretch void grab rope untie end
gripped pillowcase began clamber cotton snagged broken railing whole parcel money fell hand slithered dark
look shouted followed back canoe
time reached bottom crystal sitting cross legged canoe grimy wet pillowcase front
sorry
said sat
crystal laughed echoes rebounded choruses happiness
others
asked
take fair share replied
trust respect thats works
extracted bags money stowed haul dry sack front boat set dark
moneys stolen police find
asked
heard tuffy
gambling bad habit
saving people
case money
make money
make rules
dont play game
anyway money isnt
hands toiled build canal forgotten felt knew work
thought must dignified purposeful people
travelling tunnel strange experience
escaping yet tunnel held captive within dark subterranean universe
black brick lined tube seemed endless remote living world
loss sight enhanced senses became breeze detectives
temperature smell feeling filled thoughts
despite sounds around completely quiet place ever known
peaceful reverence pervaded tunnel demanded respectful silence
learned see worms eye view ever distance held image pinprick light yet unseen marked entrance real world lay beyond
tunnel continued many miles
paddled regular pace deep night resting occasionally journey city long arduous
long day felt sleepy
although want stop felt sure safe free tiredness overcame
found railing far beyond drain park secure canoe slept
canoe good accommodation two sleep
wide enough sleep side side short end end
covered best possible jackets laid heads sack money centre canoe
good night harry yawned crystal thanks
slept fitfully uncomfortably curled bottom boat
water dripped constantly roof around thankfully little landed
absolute darkness unnerving found impossible measure passage time endless deep night tunnel
woke cold hungry sunday lightless dawn false morning
crystal planned escape well rations rat proof tin hidden bow
meagre snack set moving darkness subterranean day
back ached hard night canoe good going
tunnel turned series wide curves first one way another
many passages leading main channel moved constant fear losing way swept weir
slow going guess right way
twice back dead ends
day hardly spoke never felt need
often crystal start hum paddled along
started sing immediately stopped
go said love hear sing
no no yet
wont sing safe free
paddled silence
early evening finally approached tunnel entrance
last hundred yards tunnel numerous junctions main channel sub divided two equal parts
consulting compass chose left route continued way
disturbingly tunnel seemed getting smaller duck avoid hitting heads
smell change air
something free infiltrating close confines hint freshness darkness
ever lowering roof disquieting emerged final bend saw light distance
last rosy flare sunset reflected water creeping hazy evening air
thought tiredness dropped away cramped limbs paddled renewed vigour
felt new excitement thrill piloted canoe swiftly along
pinpoint quickly grew inverted horseshoe shaped opening
air gloom became fresher still distant sounds penetrated tunnel
bright dynamics natural world released blinkered stifled senses
small craft came rest heavy rusty iron grating lay like portcullis across entrance
peered bars imprisoned heart sank

asked
dont worry way crystal replied
lets see see first
vast empty mistiness outside covered marsh
filled air far see
watched evening sun dipped horizon far right clouds looked like mountains
no sign human habitation ample wildlife raucous calls ducks geese great billowing clouds gnats mosquitoes occasional plop rat entering water filled air ahead
night descended quickly across marshes darkness
sleep said crystal
least safe place stay tonight
see safe perhaps safe
break barrier ahead
tired tied canoe inside grating
lay best beneath coats cool dark
sleep soon overcame discomfort big city filled dreams
awoke start
looked nervously around expected see familiar surroundings bedroom

slowly recalled previous night disturbingly canoe no longer tunnel entrance crystal nowhere
alone
first thought shes abandoned
shes left
felt slight panic thought hit
settled
no done

used dark days perpetual night make outline tunnel tell kind junction several tunnels leading different directions
felt torch gone
crystal must taken
settled wait
little else
trust said
time trust
hear strange noise distance coming nearer
sounded like high pitched wind whatever heading towards
suddenly black shadow shot overhead another another
dropped floor canoe
rushing noise turned squealing screech hoards bats flew overhead
air thick creatures
flew inches head filled whole tunnel
must thousands tiny mammals
air solid black
noise deafening
animals started landing crouched canoe
feel hair
enveloped hundreds tiny bats flapping squealing
tried beat crawling arms face biting hands
claws razor sharp hands scalp
hard breathe air stank
came crowded around
many tiny talons cheeks
dared open eyes
open mouth shout help
panic moment something
tried stand mass bats made impossible
thing think tumbled canoe river submerged completely
bats dropped mad confusion
stayed long hold breath emerged gasping
horror immediately attacked
ducking waded half waddling tunnel
every seconds put head breath
time still bats fewer fewer
stood walked half running tunnel turning twisting dozen junctions surrounded silence
stood dripping inky black
bats gone completely lost
found edge tunnel slimy weed slowly made way back first junction
discern least three ways
crystal crystal
said loud
sounded loud voice turned whisper fear overtook
stood silently
completely dark feel water moving past legs
course course
follow flow
started walking every junction stopped still feel water flowing past
minutes later came large tunnel junction
sure back main tunnel
followed walls came ledge suddenly cracked shins canoe
dim light seen reflecting water far distance
suddenly blotted
involuntarily tensed expectation
no noise followed
moved dry things canoe way climbed dripping onto thwart
long passageway beside leading tangent main channel still wide enough take canoe
ready loosen painter paddle round sight
minute later soothed stiff limbs saw shadowy shape crystal wading water towards
getting closer turned torch
carried trousers draped shoulder
chrissy whispered
welcoming smile dropped saw
whatevers happened
look like youve fallen boat

shone torch face gasped

perimeter big city airport lay sight man made plateau
terminal already coming noisily life mile behind

crystal stood water watching waiting
slowly crouched close bank stayed motionless bare legged statue
concentration task seemed total
looked fascinated entranced
communion nature
moment discovery
strange girl selfless nave yet full knowledge experience
moment felt warmth inside known
knew friend new friend seemed almost dreamlike alone magical girl
fish moved shadows river bank hung current drifting crystals shadow
hands water
gently crystal stroked bodies two large trout sheltered shade
smallest rhythmical movements seemed entrance fish submission
completely involved task
suddenly without warning
caught two trout landed bank
gleaming silvery fish stunned gunwale crystal took knife headed towards tunnel
using brick wall workbench gutted beheaded fish
youve done see
come called bring canoe
took rope followed back shadows
blinded dark tunnel hung back entrance minute
tied canoe orders crystal went back find sufficient dry material small fire
used knife good effect returned tunnel armful reeds rushes together two pieces driftwood found caught riverbank
crystal pulled tin bottom canoe made fire ledge
matches thankfully pocket went water
still within sight entrance two tunnels branched
flickering light spread ghastly shadows across old brickwork fire smoked somewhat
fish skewered two sticks held flames
pleased warmth wet clothes
quickly doused flames fish cooked
sat edge tunnel eat meal
food rudimentary satisfying
tunnel flues drawn smoke darkness hoped disperse emerged
returned canoe daylight cautiously started walk river
crystal front turned gave odd look laughed
silly harry
said still looking cant walk river like
youll need dry clothes sleep tonight
feel blushing
dreading moment
right smiled
ill look way
knew right
wrung sodden socks trousers draped canoe dry sun
felt like began enjoy adventure
grey smoky pall hung big city behind
mixture mist pollution made peculiar atmosphere seemed somehow apt
felt secure marsh practically invisible vastness surroundings
no roads near place luck long passage secret river tunnel deadened scent followers might attempted find
late summer sun kept warm watery surroundings
clothes soon dried made reasonable progress
even seen no reason attract special attention
edge airport soon became noisy blot amongst general haze behind
ahead air cleared midday see across far side marsh distance beyond
firm banks stream receded back high reed beds surrounded either side making progress invisible except air
water level small private world
stream walking along seemed keep less course far side marsh albeit straight path
fortunately crystal seemed element among reed beds walked ahead reading way precision
side stream joined main river heard crystal sigh stood looked scene
water channel seemed half empty
able row canoe
damn dam hissed
progressed along old river narrower channel snaking old broad river bed became
gradual change took place surroundings reeds either side gave way tussocky humps protruded boggy brown peat
cotton grass waved white fluffy heads waters edge occasional half fallen alder trees attempted grow stonier places
river widened little marsh gave way firmer ground water channelled rivulets low banks
way led sparse woodland crack willows
stood twisted gnarled ancient half leaning half fallen swamp
stopped shade
evening approaching water becoming cold bare legs walk river much longer
tied canoe made camp night firm ground among trees
ducks eggs sorrel leaves crystal collected earlier day extended fishy diet
cook meal evening mist started descend hide smoke fire
ate glorious sunset flooded misty skies crimson gold
looked quietly talked

magic said meeting coming going going

dont need think
perhaps said crystal dreamily

think sleep
tired dark theres still long way go tomorrow
tuesday morning journey continued marshes
becoming weary watery wilderness surrounded
needed shelter good food
found difficult walk soft ground muddy streambeds felt tired
water channels grew smaller often heave canoe reeds banks coarse grass
air marshes humming insects constantly surrounded got hair mouth eyes
think well call place midge marsh joked crystal waved hand clouds insects surrounded
swarms mosquitoes left sore itching
dank pools water bubbled either side fresh water streams foul marsh gas filled air loathsome stench
one point stumbled nest water snakes
sinister creatures slid directions jumped canoe safety
kept wary eye open marsh creatures ventured forth
dont like much admitted
something makes uneasy
cant feel
yes
something ahead
think theres something waiting
dont know
heading towards way go
sooner reach woods better replied
take cover
tuesday night slept canoe last time
safety moored centre small river broadened substantial pond barrier silt
air much colder previous nights managed well enough
become used hard cramped sleeping quarters slept well
awoke early wednesday morning sound sensation falling rain
feet canoe heron stood one foot water quizzical expression face
great bird flapped wings awkwardly slowly ascended fly away south
damp cold decided proceed without breakfast find shelter
days journey began
paddled edge pond walked relative cover sometimes difficult terrain sparse woodland
began see sandstone shale banks either side lay miniature cliffs terraces rose firmer ground
twice glimpsed iridescent flash kingfisher flying hole bank
midday woodland closed forest oak beech marshland behind
river spread shallow stony brook inches deep time come let canoe go
carried deep pool beneath small waterfall filled stones water sank
sad leave behind good home
gathering packs walked woods top small rocky hill view land
fortunately rain stopped air clear
surprised no longer see big city distance behind
even marsh beyond woodland indistinct
knew encounter signs human habitation somewhere ahead planned buy wholesome food soon
well trodden path hill led towards road meant must village town somewhere distance
passed time walking along path telling crystal something legend mythras include story crystal journey across water
eventually saw roofs distance
struck across heathland towards settlement
finally walked main square small town late afternoon
tired hungry
place small attractive market town ideal purpose
appeared holiday destination big city folk sightseers walking
already decided pose hikers holiday need arose
bought map snacks small shop found quiet place rest eat
money pillowcase much expected crystal intend use ill gotten windfall journey
said dangerous
instead small sum used buy food
went camping shop used last crystals money buy tiny inconspicuous tent
set find shelter night
decided woodland best place stay located forest area map
hill miles town appeared provide perfect cover
carrying heavy loads slowed passage eating wholesome meal improved spirits renewed strength
evening beautiful happy take time reach destination
came steep valley deep woods grove ancient yew trees
quiet even sullen
no bird song place silence complete intimidating made whisper
dark vale ordinarily inviting fulfilled wish quiet undisturbed halt night
presence almost invisible even within coomb
bottom wood small clearing made camp beside stream
decided light fires already eaten go directly sleep rise first light morning get long days travelling belts refreshed
inside tent shut mournful gloom silent valley long fell restless sleep
several times awoke sound animals moving outside
heard rustling leaves quiet snuffling sounds creatures night searched food
sombre quiet even clicking beetles undergrowth seemed loud
felt tense lay listening night
deep black darkness dense felt crushing
somehow sinister tunnels
drifted back uneasy sleep
crystal woke early hours awakened
yet light something manner seemed agitated urgency voice
dont like place whispered
lets go
dont like either
replied
eerie
silently gathered belongings
use torch
suddenly distance heard strange noise
stopped stock still waited silence
animal maybe
chilled
lets leave tent
well collect later
whispered
slid dark crystal handed bags
cautiously crept behind nearby bush
air tense still though storm might approaching
crystal followed flitted bush bush tree tree back head small coomb
dark valley see anything along ridge hill night sky showed lighter grey behind silhouettes trees
crouched still looked around several slow silent minutes
feeling unease persisted felt better open surprised
strange sound came something like howl vixen closer time
suddenly saw two strange shadows top hill
stood quite still
seemed sniffing air
nearly stopped breathing
stood hundred yards away looking valley
moved disappeared
almost panicked stood ground
hear faint movement dark went quiet moment
second later distant metallic scratching sound followed quickly blaze fire
set tent alight valley filled furious brief inferno
watched two daemonic figures dancing round blazing tent
flames spread ghoulish shadows trees strange animal cries echoed woods triumphant loud
ghastly enchanting
crystal tugged hand ran fast away terror
bounded undergrowth dragging packs along
twigs snapped brambles scratched faces hands still kept running
saw pale light clearing ahead stopped still standing heaving breath pounding hearts
forest road front bounded high laurel hedge
behind silent
crawled hedge hidden
lets wait til daybreak whispered hoarsely
took crystals hand felt hot trembling
pulled gently ground sat back back inside hedge waited waited
time passed slowly
saw no one except shadows trees heard nothing wind branches
dawn showed grey sky frightening events night seemed fade away dreams
cant stay longer freezing
lets go said crystal suddenly
okay
well safe getting light
small confidence returned sun stood stepped onto dirt road continue journey
immediately walked sudden noise behind awful call strange men
saw edge woodland track
started run towards ran no use
harry
theyre going catch cried crystal
well fight shouted back
make stand
stopped turned stood together panting
felt crystals hand
around fifty yards away
dropped packs faced raced towards
wore tattered black robes carried long poles
deep hoods shaded faces
stood gripping others hand
wait til get close say run round one side
said trembling voice
twenty feet go opened mouth shout
suddenly stopped
absolute silence
stood shivering fear resolute stood yards away poles raised strike
feel tears terror rising eyes
crystals hand gripped mine resolutely
silence heard blood pumping head
something changed turned quickly fled back road like pair frightened dogs
looked confused wondering
spontaneously hugged relief dare turn away
crystal
thought going die
worse replied
go
dont know lets get return
picked packs turned walk stopped still stood
path fifty paces behind stood two large horses surmounted two riders looked sternly
finely dressed horsemen wore uniforms gold deep green
chestnut horses wore silken gold green cloths beneath saddles
cloths bore symbol double cross

whispered
good bad
look double cross crystal whispered back
riders approached slowly
gold horseman spoke clearly deep steady voice found time

asked shakily
lords double cross spoke emerald lord interest prize carry
safe said companion gold lord
follow place unwanted friends return
saying turned horse walked slowly away
crystal looked
seem know lot whispered
well go replied resignedly
least look civilised somewhat time
feel like ive walked medieval dream
emerald lord dismounted signalled walk ahead
bade crystal ride saddle took reins lead great horse
know handle even great horse think
little alternative requested strange folk
terror night still fresh mind seemed least safe passage away unknown aggressors
size strength horses bearing men bred confidence security
also fascination
people
know
significance double cross
take
questions filled mind minutes met horsemen
small band forest track seemed mysteriously ancient
silence woods removed thoughts modern life mind
noble horses finely dressed lords walking together along mossy way surrounded dripping misty trees like picture romantic childhood story
fluting lazy late summer song birds combined earthy smell approaching autumn air lead dream like unreality
accepted new companions saviours knew
strange feeling larger play enacted part
yet also become aware step new history also linked magic mythras white crystal
seemed travelling backward time old different future
looked passing trees almost seemed watching
emerald lord caught eye began recite poem
deep bass voice reassuring words beautiful
forest reach fine tree hold eye
dark free pine tree sharp silhouette sky
wind plays breezes branches sun ignites colours fiery glances
luxuries beech woods fill earth sky
like chameleons seasons fables filled reasons truth never lie
winter freezes cold ghostly skeletons haunt forest floor
despite death exterior hearts warm life suspended core voices whisper sleeping dreams time barely creeping
late summer morning see leaves making patterns mind ecstasy movement shivering pictures liquid beauty shattered mirrors sharpened splinters like icicles forgotten winters warmly dancing sky
come reach fine tree natures glory eye
love words see love words also said emerald lord fell silent
true something poem filled new hope
good man true hold things sacred
party moved ahead steadily quietly accompanied soft footfall horses hooves leaf mould forest sounds bird wind stream
path took upwards towards hilly crown woods
reverie walked contentedly
seemed reality become dream
within felt men trusted least
crystal spoke
going
safe place
must know inadvertently put danger
found must followed
seen follower
asked gold lord
two followers
asked
no replied emerald lord dangerous little local villains
follower forward ways
yes replied
seen shadow follower
since left big city
good said emerald lord
think left ancient way even unaware
must trust ask
know trust
asked crystal
gold lord drew horse back alongside scrutinised face
said know someone trust
heard crystal draw breath
gold lord continued know trust
trust gained short
travelled many miles find companion bring safety
admit looking two
perhaps rather case whether trust
expect trust actions words endeavour show honest open true
need must judge may help
travellers journey foolish young brave offer safe passage dangerous land
give trust say wish go alone much grieve may
understand obliged oath protect still distance past days watching
horseman looked towards summit approaching spoke
also another matter
one wishes speak companion

enquired simply
may feel know already
name wolfe
shrugged
dont know name
heard called names mythras
magician
cried
no one may mind
name mythras title
speak place may safe
unwelcome companions know assume follower also knows
saying gold lord rode ahead party climbed final slope clearing top forest
outcrop rock prevented trees taking purchase
windy place commanded view around compass sea distance behind mountains ahead
much closer towered horizon
great slopes rose rank upon rank wooded foothills bare escarpments beyond snow covered peaks lay glistening sun
looking traced whole journey distant grey smudge big city shimmering flat marshes across low level woods past town forest
gazed distant light sea find island home lost view
wondered ever return
stop breakfast said emerald lord unpacked saddlebag containing food drink
travelled well much journey complete
cold wind sweeping across hills distant mountains eating returned gratefully shelter trees
travelled seldom used paths horses picked way carefully stones undergrowth
day passed quietly journeyed deep thought
gold lord rarely spoke passed time silence
emerald lord seemed freer mind talked pointing features place
lull began chant ballad great length beauty
seemed old tune strange yet familiar
rhythm fitted easy pace horses
recall verses
tale minstrel sailed across sea met princess although fell love part go separate ways
strangeness circumstance walk beautiful
forest extensive vista vista opened ridge climbed slowly towards towering hills
people met shepherds passed lead sheep goats winter grazing
two lords always make way shepherds turn bid good day
struck two lords appear strangers people
shepherds give crystal straight long stare passed made no comment
eventually came long wall climbed hills sight
seemed incongruous travelling many miles without sign mans endeavours
party followed wall around track way gate
standing gate old man dressed white
came forward speak gold lord
welcome friend said firm voice great horseman dismounted
two men shook hands flicker smile crossed faces

took pillowcase made balaclava hat protect face eyes
found drawer pair leather gloves protect hands
still wearing fine clothes crawled claustrophobic fireplace tried climb
first attempt failed grip sides flue feet
removed shoes socks slung laces belt tried
able grip courses bricks fingers toes wedging back side flue slowly scrape way skyward
chimney filthy pungent smell soot damp filled nostrils makeshift hat effective keeping worst face
flue became narrower towards top managed push way
knew one false move crash bottom lost
limbs ached trembled exertion climb struggled find toehold support top
chimney no pot gaping square brick stack slanted holes made side draught
dislodged loose bricks one side pushed hole
time strain limbs support weight pressing back stack becoming painful desperate
bricks fell rumbling crash froze loud report no sounds followed continued enlarge hole reach carefully let bricks
eventually big enough crawl
looked edge semi dark saw large flat lead covered roof perhaps twenty similar stacks emerging
sighed relief good fortune finding flat roof
took last strength crawl hole tumble outside

tiptoed back room make escape
wedged door shut stood moment silence listening following footsteps heard none
crystal silently laughed saw light
soot dirt covered clothes still pillowcase head
brushed washed hands quickly grabbing packs joining crystal sitting room
clock showing quarter midnight fifteen minutes less wolfe discover missing
unlike mine bedroom small stone balcony tied rope knotted earlier balustrade
crystal went first disappearing darkness
see rope went slack jerked twice
pulled rope tied backpacks
lowered one time
seemed take forever tie untie knots
kept looking behind door
suppose wolfe early
last ready climb
hands feet already sore blistered climbing chimney rope little thin cut painfully skin
dropped last four feet land beside friend
way freedom five midnight
sat slipped socks shoes gathered packs
raw hands swollen feet slowed progress
finally ready
somewhere inside great house clock began strike midnight
happened next terrified shock surprise
ear splitting crack
dropped ground
followed deep thunderous rumble somewhere far
felt ground move beneath jumped pulled crystal away house
earth shivering violently balustrade crashed ground crushing rope beneath spot crouching
frightening silence filled air
tremor passed
earth held breath
stood momentarily stunned fixed spot
crystal grabbed hand dragged away place
way lets go called hoarsely
turned ran fast across lawns wall
heart pounded panic
behind house came sound shouting commotion
scrambled wall ran woods behind house towards path led mountains
somewhere ahead heard wolf cry night
harry descending rope balustrade ground wolfe deep beneath house old mines checking preparations
old man planned leave house night knew probably return
threw last boxes papers books smouldering cauldron molten rock
fires erebos consumed many volumes studies night
wolfe no longer needed
white crystal almost possession receive knowledge seeking life
thought able move different time infiltrate place history unseen unknown welcome unwelcome
planned influence world shaman become mystery force no one stop
wolfe understood magic stone eager possess
wolfe knew harry white crystal guessed kept
first thought take force
gold lord suspicious
careful
must no trace
bottle camphor ready silence boy room
old magician take stone bring boy molten pit
knew needed spell magic words lost
crystal boy possessed
take long get spoken spell harry tonight
no one defy terror hung pulpit appalling molten lake long
wanted let boy drop lava consumed no trace left
wolfe use crystal leave erebos
dawn already many miles away unseen maybe years away
intended go council elders secretly discover source power
infiltrate chambers power wherever found
wolfe become sicarius mythras last
trembled excitement thought future
old live forever
task completed wolfe ascended house went harrys room
key hand ready unlock door
turning twelve oclock stood outside room moment hesitated
great tower clock struck first chime midnight cracking sound loud thunderbolt filled air
came beneath house
part plan
heart stopped second turned ran stairs towards mines
left doors open take boy
must closed
ground beneath began shiver ran tunnel
door behind crashed shut
roaring like thunder echoed along corridors sound hurt ears
walls moved rocks cracked jagged lines head
turned ran back door move
no escape
glowing mass choking sulphurous smoke billowed along tunnel towards wolfe cowered corner
held breath closed eyes long
opened eyes smoke risen vibration stopped
erebos silent breathed relief
still shaking tried door held fast
harry crystal moment escaping mountains wolfe prisoner mines erebos
workings abandoned many centuries lava flow broken tunnels slowly claiming another victim
pressure building silent mines
already magma pool nearly filled huge chamber
glowing molten rock crept along slowly climbing spiral passage pushed inexorably forward unstoppable pressure beneath earths crust
walls tunnel around began glow dull red fearful heat
wolfe stood waited awful ruddy light
rocks around grinding rasping pressure built
rock cracked crumbled walls ceiling
wolfe faced final avenger madness filled mind screamed terror
turned scratch heavy steel door sealed broken
suddenly lights went split glowing dark huge roar anger
tra
turned face oncoming doom dropped knees
spoke quiet voice last words world no one hear
forgive harry mad
destruction
looking proud face looked world weary aged face man resigned death
gentle face sad face perhaps found truth last
meanwhile tremor lords double cross assembled drawing room
searched house found wolfe harry crystal disappeared
gold lord looked shaken spoke
believe wolfe turned evil
seen earlier
may already failed
everyone search property guests
fear lives
find wolfe spare mad voice rasped spoke
young ones
asked emerald lord
fear taken
may dead already maybe worse grimaced
began search suspicions heightened found wolfe removed many precious books belongings
none suspected truth none knew disused mines house
gold lord despatched two messengers warn council elders
remainder party found no clues searched house grounds
two tremors night neither animals servants stay near place longer
decided shut house go heartland safer ground
morning come lords double cross left never return erebos lay deserted desolate corrie mountains
crystal climbed steadily night high hills old house find old paths seen marked maps
night strangely quiet
animals terrified earthquake fled
tremor also scared little else except continue walk
moon shone lit scene cold pale light revealed every tree rock sharp sinister silhouettes
two wary travellers kept cover much able
every sound seemed loud silence night second distant wolf like cry made freeze tracks
sound subsided echoes valleys erebos continued haste
many hours walking found shepherds hut hillside
pushed open door entered place rest
exhausted
slept feet door heads packs
dawn broke mountains awoke crystal old tumbledown shelter
ate sparingly knowing long supplies might need last
cautiously opened door went cool morning light
mountains towered majestically
detect black form large bird circling early thermal high soft blue sky
perhaps half dozen smaller birds gulls chasing dipping diving calling fear agitation great bird
eagle floated serene unfettered protestations beneath
watching eagles slow deliberate movements early air filled hope
dropped suddenly distant remote cliff face close mountain top
behind crystal stopped still behind placed hand shoulder
thank said quietly knew troubles shared
stood silence alone thoughts together
valley far make distant form erebos empty windows glinting sun
turned back evil place began walk old sheep track
path crossed bridge stream continued head valley crystal hoped find road eventually take towards fathers farm
walked along path beside stream
water little trickle stream bed deep wide channel fit mountain river water eroded rock centuries
crystal looked small stream despair appeared determined step forward upward
hands clenched fists stride became sure firm
noticed seemed looking something ahead
crystal
asked
youll see
youll see soon enough replied fists clenched even tighter
climbed wooded valley beside stream bed
dense foliage enclosed slopes valley head see open sky
clambered final steep slope onto exposed rocky ridge
air cold clear
ascended hundreds feet mountains
crystal climbed last feet ridge stopped short looked straight ahead
heard draw breath hiss like angry snake
suddenly saw
object crystals hate dam loomed
stood like fortress wall across valley
emerging base massive silver pipeline snaked valley distance
pipeline drained life fathers farm many others
water company never planned compensation reservoir people lived heartland
thats whispered looked awe smooth wall ahead
know intended reached dam
crystal wanted see monstrous construction understand enemy
imagined somehow stopping water pipeline act sabotage knew deep within hopeless foolish try anything
also knew need bare hands destroy mighty barrier
clambered steep slope onto broad new road switch backed way dam
road seemed incongruous remote area
stepped boldly along deserted carriageway reached dam mile long walk
construction massive
main wall dam buttressed sloping pillars wide coping overhung valley
road ran across top wall broad black
high parapet wall railings either side
looked across roadway saw arid mountainside dropped great lake curved away distance peaks rose either side
tower stone emerged like strange concrete island centre lake
wind swept across expanse water funnelled valley sides moaned despairingly railings
no one seen
crystal climbed onto wall beside road looked
view immense magnificent
high vantage point dam showed whole country laid like relief map
despite crystal wondered edifice size might
dam held waters check serene calm place beautiful
looked across scene noticed movement almost imperceptible ground far
relief map seemed changing minutely
ground direction erebos moving
lasted seconds moments later rumbling noise spread valleys towards
sound grew tearing crackling blast echoed round mountains engulfed fear
another tremor shouted
dont think stay
run
pulled crystals arm stood motionless wall
stared stupefied across valley
turned grabbed packs jumped road
ran back edge dam
distance heard another rumbling crack
long way scared nevertheless
beside dam small level plateau directly higher rocks
scrambled way top stood waiting listening
silence deathly silence experienced night
birds skimming lake arrived disappeared
no sign animal life anywhere
think
crystal asked trembling voice
stay replied firmly
stood watching distance see no movement heard no sound
looked mountains behind lake saw looked like smoke billowing side
avalanche
beneath began feel pulsing vibration
moments world went mad everything meant life seemed falter
ground solid inanimate became living breathing monster
rocks rippled like sail wind
lay vision became blurred
dust clouds peeled away lakeside
water lake began heave giant circular patterns formed across surface
great wave rushed broke across dam
loose boulders toppled high places crashed depths
quake passed became still still
attempted stand fell back dizzy nauseous
crystal stood slowly shaking involuntarily helped
held support walked crab like closer edge look valley
clouds dust settled water became still
everything continued though nothing occurred
saw something pointed ground front dam
wall see earth begin change colour slowly first darkened stained
ruddy earth seemed bleeding
silently slowly water lake began turn dip
time water level old streambed began rise new cascade flowed old courses
visible hole appeared like small dark tunnel concrete wall base dam
pieces concrete began break away crashed hillside
looked tiny height big enough smash old bridge tumbled crack appeared wall dam another another
hear water started gain momentum thunder break
torrent became wave washing hillside hour toiled upwards
water level lake seemed changed
dam great water greater slowly spinning whirlpool appeared
revolving mass liquid moved ever faster watching made dizzy
vortex deepened strange whistling noise filled air growing ever louder screeched fury
water appeared cracks dam began spray showers turned vast silken rainbows sun
terrible beauty scene stunning
seconds later hole became breach complete section dam wall collapsed mass flying rubble
tidal wave water washed hillside lake taken many months fill finally emptied across world violent seconds carving muddy scar went
carried everything path
small forest valley became raging green sea reappeared muddy log jam
tangled jagged remains pipeline bucked writhed like dancing snake settled lay broken hollow empty amongst debris
tide rolled towards erebos
crystal find no words say
stood silence
devastation complete
something ended crystal began weep
dont upset said quietly

crystal crying tears joy
water swept away bad return home renewed
knew part story almost
dried eyes turned
must go harry whispered hoarsely go home must go home
crystal gave friendly hug turned walk across hills hand hand
began journey heartland
two companions
somehow knew no longer felt danger
hearts felt light exhilaration filled veins sang walking song known years
crystal joined paced dusty crumpled road away disaster
unknown two home bound travellers wave water destroyed dam pipeline
far forest follower watching waiting
seen wall water heard avoid
no living thing survived overwhelming wave
away still waters lake poured great fissure opened earthquake
freshwater tide flooded tunnels erebos
house collapsed old mines noxious fiery destruction lay crushed ruined boiling pools lava erupted gaping wounds earth
water flooded across whole red smoking furnace quenched turbulent molten rock mass steaming ferment
boiling lake formed house slowly cooled
lava flows filled old tunnels secret erebos lost forever
beyond valleys highland across dusty arid plains sad farmer wife sat old farm pond dry
lady crying tears dry
man looked old slouched weary worry
river run close disappeared
two worn suitcases beside couple yard rusty car ready go
early autumn sun hazy incessant buzzing insects
man slowly raised head
shook though dispelling wrong thought
moment later leapt ran river bank
man began dance years dropped away
foul ditch sand growing damp
tiny trickle clear liquid snaked oozed miniature pool began fill
suddenly seemingly nowhere bird alighted stream began drink
man looked sky began laugh loud free victorious laugh
ran sad sombre lady took arms kissed cheek
love dearest love cant believe true
come let show come tell true led gently stream almost running
looked ditch began cry time tears streamed cheeks
hands clutched released air bent knelt beside dusty bank
scooped palm full miraculous water put lips kiss joy
crystal walked across snowy mountains three long days nights
travelled many miles along paths foothills heartland
disaster befallen place became clear found way old farmsteads crossed blasted plains
trees skeletal fields resembled desert
rains arrived aggravated pain
early equinoctial autumn storms washed away topsoil silt blocked ditches
rainwater soaked straight parched brown earth run brackish ponds no good
travelled towards crystals home desolate scenery became
farms empty many begun slow disintegration ruins
knew river already renewing land distance behind slowly filling reclaiming country relied upon life
water soon begin heal scars bring new spring
road river met old brick bridge spanned waters
always meeting place travellers ruins old inn stood gaunt silhouette roadside
place marked head ancient canal
dilapidated wharves workshops stood beside river
rusty relics sluices small crane stood abandoned quay
river canalised centuries earlier
days cars lorries canal carried farmers produce stream heart big city
late tuesday morning stopped bridge rest beneath warm autumn sun
time arrived new waters begun fill old courses
clean streams already started carry away green dank slime clear foul smelling air
new fresh perfume damp earth caressed senses place old evil
waters take long time soothe wounds land convalescence begun
stood watched solitary swan glided empty sky landed smooth waters bridge
crystal laughed loud joy
horse rider approached moving cloud dust along empty road ahead
rode steadily towards horse suddenly stopped looked ahead whinnied loudly cantering onto bridge
dust cloud settled reveal form emerald lord
looked tired worn brow furrowed finery soiled
horse whinnied shifted excitement
first emerald lord seemed unclear stooped passed hand across eyes
looked across gap dismounted strode towards
snorting steaming horse came straight across crystal pressed towards held proud head
go
go drink whispered ear horse obediently went drink waters edge emerald lord approached
looked like man shock
came silently forward touched believe real

emerald lord put hands clasped genuine warmth
taken aback

even though know

crystal patted beast animal followed obediently across bridge
coming level mounted neptune
strapped packs onto saddle bag

parting friends always sad know lay ahead ever meet
good bye crystal said looking
shall dream tonight remember tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow
may changed world changed world
took hand moment stepped back
turned horse began walk away
reached end bridge turned towards
harry asked sing couldnt
well time come
remember like
crystal sat horse sang barely see watery eyes
water filled dry ditches tears filled eyes sky dry dusty made cloudy cries
new beginnings old friends parting many ways yet love friendship never ends memories fill days
long silence broken gentle sound water running sluice
turned horse walked slowly along track across dusty plain
watched faded distance gone sight
saw emerald lord watched also seemed sad
chapter nine going home emerald lord turned smiled
harry said need travel one time
going home
looked surprise
thought coming
questioned
yes thats right going home reaffirmed
journeys adventures befallen almost put home thoughts
course knew return begin imagine become arrived
still far away
dont live suidhe
asked
no replied
sometimes feel
see grandfather visitor time
suidhe kept diaries journal
boy told tales place many years later returned mainland gave books read
always intended return suidhe
used say unfinished business even claimed left belongings safe keeping
sadly never go back
eventually became ill knew never return promised one day go place
stories told left many impressions island wanted go see really like
world strange coincidences seemed stranger kept caution turned back river
get
asked
think route clear means travel already
saying stepped river bank looked along old canal
way may free suit
remember wharves thriving many craft came
perhaps return one day
led way across road series long abandoned sheds
opened half broken doors first shed
dusty dark inside cobwebs festooned ceilings dirt covered floor
perhaps twenty large canoes stacked racks either side shed
appeared unkempt serviceable
chose one seemed newer took sunlight
minutes spent cleaning revealed old solid craft
second shed revealed selection paddles chandlery
collected things thought useful ropes canvas covers holdalls fishing net many small sundries
canoe soon kitted checked lift
placed vessel water loaded provisions
must name boat
said
lets call crystal
replied emerald lord smiling
canoe large open traditional type accommodate two paddlers baggage ease
placed duffel bag thwart
companion brought spare saddlebag stowed stern
boarded vessel set towards city
knew long journey home
looked fellow traveller canoe
no longer looked like lord ordinary man felt known long time
real name
asked
gazed quizzically replied
yes time knew real name
call emerald lord rate
paused looked directly eye
name finder may call

faltered
yes know said softly
one day tell tale work also something else

asked
must take care
safe reach island maybe even
follower still sure
thought said swept away
never said killed
follower easily stopped like living thing
no hope put scent
keep trying find
lets go said picked paddle
first mile uneventful
old canal passable care locks unusable water poured bypass cuttings sluices become blocked broken
equipment seized lack use jammed shut farmers preserve water scarce
lifted craft around three locks entered long twisting stretch waterway passed across flat plain
current sluggish
debris littered bed river projected haphazardly water lurked dangerously surface
navigated way slowly obstacles clear water ahead
shallow bottomed canoe enabled maintain reasonable speed despite dangers
finder proved good travelling companion boat emerald lord horse
knew much country travelling maintained commentary places passed
pointed features landscape often told histories
people region
farming area water disappeared farms mostly empty demise population dwindled
consequently passage downstream remained largely unnoticed
seen place patchwork miniature world heights snowy mountains
seemed indistinct like model landscape distance
reality place quite different impression received
overall tidiness soft misty quality myriad farms fields really scene gentle desolation nature attempting reclaim piece world
nature requires earth air sun water
already banks old canal begun green new growth
grasses plants changed hue within days river refilling
desert brown filled distance ahead water barely reached roots river bank yet behind trees seemed almost luxuriant comparison
new green world arising like phoenix sun scorched earth
rhythm paddles creak wood slow rush water reached ears like words air even thought finder began sing
end day approached found small backwater provide safety shelter night
long slow sunset plains glowed wispy fiery orange clouds quietly melded deep crimson dulled frosty night
traced course river twilight twisting silken mists rose water hung like vaporous wraiths evening air
forgotten sounds returned river bank splash otter slipping current rush ducks wings landed emerald brown spray creamy foam
sounds occasional whisper water wandering dark beautiful quiet
absolute silence fear perceptible silence countryside beside river night unbroken interference man
atmosphere trust like gentle caress fluid whisperings stroked mind perfect pure peace
talked quietly long night looked dark star sprinkled sky
looked like pollen dust bed black velvet
silver gibbous moon rose journey void
told finder adventures big city subterranean passage beneath city streets journey across marshes boat
turn told lords caught small town beyond marsh
followed woods found follower strange wolf men
lonely yew wood busy place night
tell follower said
finder remained grimly quiet talk
wait light replied
wolfe questioned
believe wolfe saw no longer never know certainty
clever thoughtful man become corrupted boredom life
wanted something everyday existence
thought substance life greater eating sleeping day day routine
thought ordinary life prison
believe wrong structure key freedom
structure life takes care earthly needs allows enjoy spiritual freedom abide uncertain world
answer old man much older lords double cross
lived erebos many years
lived travelled far wide many years
course known wolfe called white lord one company
way leader lords double cross like leaders found really slave people without no power
one reason interested possession jealous power appeared give
wished power alone control
although knew white crystal indeed became obsessed understand failed make magic work
discovered white crystal also possessed secret made work needed able use
decided obtain secret well rather think sought destroy
showed furnace beneath house said
sure ended flames
mean really molten pool
heard finders turn surprised
killed replied finder earnestly
sure intention

understand finder
see go realise isnt real magic white crystal said
good luck bad luck surrounding equal measure
hard work sweet enjoyment no magic
things happened life world work
understand
power

perhaps started wasnt even
finder stopped paddling looking spoke
harry words kind magic
first time white crystal owner understand spell
said profound true
journey yet far go time essence
yes time essence thing
want understand
need understand crystals sake
finder looked surprised continued
erebos sleeping
dam mountain taken water away balance place disturbed
earth cracked results saw felt
much came pass foreseen hidden power erebos terrifying surprise
lords first feared wolfe wrought terror found missing thought worst occurred
may yet chance start anew
think turn start early tomorrow
shuddered thought molten pool wolfe intended destiny
talked little travellers travelling settling sleep deep undisturbed anything dreams
wednesday morning awoke sun although see
moored canoe centre waterway safety looked across water
saw wren hopping fitfully undergrowth river bank watched delight movement beyond reeds suddenly disturbed tiny bird
felt coldness sweep put hand wake finder still sleeping
woke quickly followed gaze something large moved swiftly away close ground

whispered
know finder replied urgency voice
must move soon
day dawned cloudy grey
cold mists threaded silvery strands water
clouds stretched single featureless blanket across visible world
chill air feel autumn coming
made hasty breakfast washing renewed waters river went swiftly way
day night passed without event time seamless clouds
paddled stealthily downstream aided current canal become choked weeds silt frequently forced drag canoe along banks
progress slow steady evening ready rest
despite tiredness took turns sleep watch night mindful former visitor
coldness blackness seemed interminable remained quiet
thursday bypassed numerous locks river descended coastal plain
hard work lifting dragging canoe around dozens lock gates travelled short distance morning
journey home started wave relief pleasure changed
felt uncertain nervous
progress slowed every day

come town wish experience madness
several times heard strange sounds caught breath no sightings wolf men journey far
finder weary determined rest close town morning
made way marshes side small creek away main river
air hummed sound insects
no breeze sun shone like bloody red disc haze
billowing cumulus piling horizon
evening meal familiar mists descended shroud
tonight temperature drop air grew ever muggier
hear storm grumbling far distance decided spread tarpaulin canoe
crouched dark hood canvas supported paddles rope almost cosy
slept first long awoke flash lightning crash thunder
rain drummed tarpaulin inches head bounced water around canoe
grown cold rain blew open ends shelter
finder sat hunched cover faced night
lightning flooded darkness brief cold flashlight momentarily exposed world outside motion suspended
see far place creek bank one side ten feet away
finder swung canoe around face bank avoid worst soaking
storm abating flashes still traced clouds

thing ageless ancient terrifying yet
suddenly began see little chink light understanding finder told
made no reply wondered follower shadow end days
good evil
paddled silence
canal cut circuitous route away streams crystal followed outward journey
curved broad path across plain
many streams fed part river people continued maintain use canal construction dam
original purpose cargo transport changed years barges travelled along old waterway modern times
passed many pleasure boats moored near locks seemed deserted
final stretch river ahead big city empty travellers boats
old passage river city forgotten channel silted blocked long way grating stood entrance tunnel
river entered marsh
water shallow paddling waded dragging canoe behind
smog bound city sat quietly horizon like giant grey pink crab growing larger every mile travelled towards
became aware change two miles airport perimeter sight distant buildings outer city
airport silent
no planes taking landing although see activity farther side
city folk diverted approach tunnel entrance built airport channel curved right petered bank silt
climbed bank found old channel river entered tunnels grating
scene devastation
tunnel collapsed
bricks rubble mixed mud debris filled dozens wide trenches slashed across airport like branches tree
fallen tunnels cut runways two
looking distance saw ruined remains old underground river channel
looked though gigantic knife cut city half
earthquake struck parts released river centuries underground captivity
one brief violent movement dramatically revealed unknowing uncaring city dwelt arrogantly ignorantly
destruction great allow passage water
abandoned canoe lifted possessions onto backs
cant believe place chrissy came
seems age away
somewhere round caught fish cooked told finder
started walking big city
kept line river best piles rubble destruction prevented walking directly along
covered wide flat expanse airport
took hours clamber across many small channels
last came perimeter climbed tumble security fence city outskirts
everywhere people city clearing mess rubble conduits water surprised
gangs men women laboured build temporary shelters place broken houses
tireless working folk put aside fashion finery seemed quite different ones seen outward journey
stopped looked passed
completely inconspicuous
another pair carrying possessions backs heading somewhere else
story times
realised way people dress behave day day flow soul
become followers ephemeral slight social fashion
real people digging survival
despite adversity maybe seemed happier
probably seen people angrily driving useless cars crowded streets
yet knew time circumstance divided two peoples still
taken disaster life threatening shock system bring real citizen heartwood beneath veneer fashion modernity
every district city river cut across main roads left almost useless condition
hastily erected footbridges enabled pedestrians cross old river recently returned
walked carrying loads seven eastern districts big city park stood big city gang
green acres covered thousands tents
city within city
scar old river ran mass tumbled masonry rubble
slight silvery reflection waters river visible beneath fallen tunnel
looking around see elegant buildings perimeter park place tall modern hotels empty space behind screen trees
quake razed famous buildings
workmen busy erecting fences around heaps tangled steel concrete
looked like city war
skyscrapers destined never replaced
lesson learnt
came dell beside river formed pool
fallen trees covered ground
dozens people queuing fill water buckets
water hole buzzing chatter rested fallen trunk eat lunch
sat beside trees old woman walked rivers edge knelt
cupped hands lifted water lips whispered air
well never
old woman walked spoke
never believed girl right know
told
like food
asked
yes please dear
havent eaten today
got bit lost trying find queue continued
know girl came saw tell found
found
asked half guessing reply
called secret river
said still see park

one day came round horse

crystal said
crystal help laughing joy thought
every turn
well never old lady looked hard
yes thats right
yes crystal
hope shes alright
looked dell stood duffy crystal horse
penny thoughts said finder chewing piece cheese

thinking
friends used live underground near river
dont suppose theres much chance survived
old lady took leave shambled along edge tumbledown masonry marked passage river
meal moved city passed back seven western districts
weather warmer metropolis season less obvious
air seemed strangely still no sounds except natural sounds
no traffic choked atmosphere people walked centre carriageway
city returned short people
passed street close shopping district saw solitary horse trotting towards
carless city horse seemed quite keeping
horse looked moment whinnied turned continued way
recognised look eye smiled speak
late friday evening finally arrived quayside sun already lay hidden horizon
silhouettes warehouses cranes seemed familiar almost homely
stood two quiet shadows beside docks
looked around remembering
must try find big city gang said
hope suffered quake lived tunnels
nobody finds harry
said familiar voice darkness
gloom night detected figures walking towards
one approached stood feet away
tuffy spoke

tuffys command gang disappeared shadows returned eight old bicycles

asked
roads aint get good said muffy
got one invisible mate said huffy proudly
everyone laughed huffy turned little pink dark
journeyed creaking convoy city centre arrived little midnight
pleasure palace deserted
place amusement park closed repairs earthquake damaged rides
gang easily broke main gates rode empty car park style amazement singing big city anthem
left gates swinging tuffy led low dark building edge pleasure palace
duffy forced doors gemmy entered alone
torch tuffy told use unless
others left walked centre completely black space
dark intense almost feel pressing skin
twenty paces stopped turned waited
lesser dark square doors stood open inviting
nothing moved silence hummed ears
waited watched grey space ahead
without senses began lose panicked run shadow suddenly appeared
silent black figure wide brimmed hat deeper black dark grey doorway
thought standing still first although no sound shadow slowly grew knew approaching place stood
grey square behind shadow figure suddenly silently disappeared absolute blackness
no escape
follower time
held white crystal darkness
began emit thin pure white sparkling light
light slowly grew around tiny points star light appeared darkness
follower emerged grey shadows front outstretched arm
reached towards crystal stopped invisible hand inches
stayed absolutely still
stopped breathing
arm moved forward follower deliberately clamped crystal fingers
felt icy chill touched
thought heart stop
felt senses reeling
moment tested felt give way turn run
caught glimpse crystal minds eye smiling knew free knew tide turning
crystal mine said
life
free
voice sounded halting timid quiet sound somehow built confidence repeated words much louder much clearer
life
free
moment felt fingers grip pause
crystal mine repeated
life
free despite heard voice commanding ego sum dominus temporis
heard hiss nooooo
repeated words three times ego sum dominus temporis
ego sum dominus temporis
ego sum dominus temporis
felt something change grip
suddenly released hand crystal remained aloft
felt strong much stronger anyone stronger small world men heard laugh scorn
tempted
free voice stern
choose

free time voice reverberated around space
ego sum dominus temporis
glimmering light suddenly flared around hundreds stars exploded glaring blinding flares
follower spun around fury holding hands face
ancient figure began produce wailing sigh grew searing shriek
ran edge chamber crashed mirror wall
turned ran frantically side side colliding walls shrieking
seemed search door hall mirrors lost thousand reflections cascaded away directions
stood steadfastly still waited end come
followers appearance began change liquid features slowly filled vacant shadows beneath cloak
first saw face hands surrounding reflections cascading mirrors
burning frightened eyes looked
face passed lifetime minute
ancient man stopped stared wildly looked directly lunged forward strike crystal
stood ground waiting blow fall
harry attacked reflection huge mirror shattered fragments feet
follower fell slowly ground despairing sigh rolled onto back
looked older still tired sad
lay motionless silent features changing aged beyond realms mankind kingdom ancients
moved beside looked
tears dropped cheeks
seemed harmless weak old man
face wrinkled small like monkey fathomless eyes looked across years age
felt pity super natural creature yet one kind
skin face began shrivel hoarsely whispered destruction
light faded eyes black hat sagged skeletal form visibly disintegrated
within one long minute turned heap grey ashen dust
stooped picked hat
last understood
follower gone crystal left
crystal left
crystal mine
light faded heard scraping door opened behind
big city gang moved slowly chamber finder came side
said simply
left scene death returned dock side
gang strangely quiet journey
tuffy came spoke
harry
must say good bye
know came see strong friends
look
time also come
big city gang today gone tomorrow
leave sunrise
nothing big city
people changed
discovered community
scared night ground trembled scared ever
no place gang good city
survived no star chamber secret ways removed without trace
things think maybe
no matter find new world new place mountains maybe
perhaps find source old stream
going may remember
good bye harry
bon voyage
remember free
murmur others sank shadows
good bye
blurted
go mountains good luck go
felt something well inside
wanted follow belong night
gone sudden sorrow settled stared night
shadows melted away heard no reply
felt saddened big city gang forced leave relieved well
finder remained quiet time looked away towards sea
night breeze chill salty wind dried eyes looked suidhe home lay cloaked darkness
walked silent streets ferry terminal
closed deserted sign outside announced resumption island service morning
spent uncomfortable night half sleeping grimy bench
travelling companion remained silent often wandered seemingly troubled
saturday early morning dawned grey cool
looked across sea towards island see
often mist descended across horizon miles land
collected bags walked door
no electric power building dark
large halls corridors within bustle travellers usually roamed day night vacant
rather dowdy man came door directed around side building car parks yards ferry waited
looked deserted
passengers boarded
crew waved aboard young seaman told need ticket journey
boat waited appointed time depart no passengers arrived
finder paced deck kept looking across wilderness empty car parks deserted roads sailors prepared boat leave
said nothing felt sure looking something
surely follower
ferry slipped moorings engines roared
vessel moved harbour channel
companion turn head shelter cabin
squall rain splattered across decks opened door stairway
descended saloon
five silent men sat benches surrounding wall looked almost statuesque
sight friends finder burst smile strode forward open armed meet
stood lords double cross dressed plain clothes greeted silence
port fading view behind wall approaching rain
ahead clouds clung sea
boat moved seemed world outside vessel dream
minutes later big city disappeared behind island yet revealed ahead
isolation empty place ocean filled strange foreboding
mind ached confusion tiredness
sat away companions seemed part larger thing one piece play already written
essence
six world worn travellers looked time gold lord spoke
harry said journey almost
pleased return home
surprised find
one day meet different place different time
ask anything except
suidhe comes view go aloft return island manner left
guardian white crystal rest days pay keep belongs island
things appear change remain things appear always changing
life grow older yet
time takes around circles experience
gold lord quiet find reply
quiet voice finder reciting another travelling poem broke thin silence surrounded
words seemed old stony minstrel told final tale
ferry cruised white fog slight shimmer blue showed across bows
rain speckled windows brightened boat emerged real world
showers lay behind ahead early morning sun burnished ocean golden light gilds autumn storms
felt blood return veins
head became flushed
something deep homely welled surface thoughts
walked unsteadily stairs deck
turning towards bow saw horizon covered green grey blue
cloud covered hills island island
suidhe home
bracing wind blew across face feel
tears trickled like rain cheeks aware
immense happiness filled overflowing familiar shape land steadily grew completed vision
seagulls chased noisily overhead
made way back place hidden outward journey thought gold lords words
understood
took white crystal hand
whispered wind ego sum dominus temporis
even island reappeared fell spell
one last time held stone hand
know
walked saloon open doors no faces turned
wondered see travelling different time
went back deck
wind blew hair
laughed loud joy waited home return
decide
felt truly free
ferry entered harbour drew dock
crew secured six lords waited cross shore
followed behind found walking land loved
ground felt firm beneath feet returned sea wall found alcove
hand released crystal
worn tired emotion
sat head nodded heard sea sloshing harbour wall dream
opened eyes inexplicably closed
yawned blinked lifted heavy head
sky clouded
morning grey damp musty smell autumn air
feeling dreaming filled mind like silent questioner
held head listened quiet except slow wash sea sound wind ears
looked
far side harbour high cliff old house saw solitary figure looking
something memory moved wondered distant man might
sat watching boat dock workers unloaded post cargo
handful passengers arrived board ferry back big city
recognised
time spent mainland seemed slipped away
sat watched harbour life done
felt never away yet knew
put hand pocket prove
hard shape brooch crystal given night left erebos given old coin sgurr cavan
took brooch looked
small almost insignificant thing seemed
simple gold shape fish set single glistening stone
wondered ever see
stood remembering lords double cross looked around see still harbour
gone
slept much night began feel drunk sleeplessness
still early morning looked like rain
walked slowly away harbour narrow street house top hill
curtains drawn across windows
parents yet
slipped around back house ledge garden amazement found window open left
heaved duffel bag climbed house quietly
shut window behind stood room
leaving clothes floor climbed bed
first proper bed slept since leaving erebos
warm sheets heavenly
snuggled within looked around small room
tired eyes closing
mantelpiece pictures wall calendar still showing day left blissfully familiar essence comfort security home
within seconds asleep
chapter ten two hearts chrissy dismounted neptune walked along dusty track towards farm home
knew happy
wishes come true yet something still dragged feet made sluggish
doubt mind
find reached old house fields
far go soon close familiar places childhood changed
sight dusty dry land made chrissy feel sad
hedges trees already brown skeletal leaves half fallen
no birds sky
strange weary silence weighed heavily upon ears oppressed thoughts
sound soft fall shoes quiet clop horse
slowed almost standstill approached final corner
chrissy took deep breath walked firmly farmhouse came view
sight old house took thoughts worry mind
heart leapt back home led horse yard
opened creaking door slowly
moment thought house empty
heart faltered everyone
no one came greet hear no sound within
chrissy walked across threshold stood gloom kitchen
heart beating fast
suddenly freeway bess two old dogs raced across room jumped
tails wagging excited eyes shining happiness
threw pack hugged dogs affectionately
freeway bess

silly old things exclaimed
picked bag stood silently listening
chrissy looked tears glistened eyes called mum dad home waited
hurried clattering feet stairs round moony face mother stared disbelievingly across room

chrissy dropped bag floor
began laugh running mother embraced

five youths strolled nonchalantly yard
one walked ahead hands pockets kicked dirt worn shoes
stopped stood front chrissy father
freeway bess stood snarling intruders
dusty city clothes youths incongruous outlandish countryside
chrissy stifled laugh surveyed five dissimilar lads
supremely confident city awkwardly scuffling dirt farmyard

time order changed forever council elders fell back memory
passing mystery strength eight broken

alone investiture climbed sgurr cavan scrambled cave entrance led chamber light seen frank many years
mass fallen rock barred entrance chamber
roof collapsed probably earthquake ten years white crystals sealed earth never found

next enter old friend frank returned best man
although rarely met intervening years remained faithful friends

took place front altar await chrissy
moment silence doors opened
everyone glanced behind

five elderly men followed slowly
took places silence
final party six lords double cross
entered dressed fine clothes special colour

looked like noble lords ancient times congregation greeted gasps
gold lord led procession
stood three side entrance held swords aloft form ceremonial arch
silence followed chrissy radiant beautiful walked slowly beneath swords aisle
service followed wedding feast held old hall cleve
butler grown old opened door party

long final dance ended chrissy made farewells knew never return
said good bye council elders strangers even
thanked lords double cross given generous gift
sad indeed turned last finder
go said return time

past land future belongs leave love dearly
took chrissys hand kissed gently shook finally turned join others left last time
watched go bittersweet moment
little later took leave party bade enjoy
left cleve amidst much noise gaiety
revellers particularly noticed farmers celebrated moment
walked night brought home bride
came pass two white crystals returned island united
years passed grown content
passage time much affected island remains haven peace refuge modern world
live happily old bedroom sleeps son
sometimes wonder find big city
never left island somehow know never
keep promise made without difficulty
hear much meet tell world outside enough
say big city water ever changing
river hidden runs proudly city dividing joining
people built twelve beautiful bridges across waters
river trees lining length gardens dip waters either side
people go relax friends ducks geese swans live happily
boats glide bridges barges sail docks carrying cargoes produce heartland farms
river also supplies city drinking water even driest weather enough
today big city famous beautiful river elegant bridges
course still busy place full people cars commerce somehow little better
identity farmers remain mystery long
big city gang gone never forget
farmers families known
told lives country helped chrissy rebuild fathers farm
tuffy come alone house day wedding asked see chrissy
pressed hand went walk briefly
known early days adventure tuffy suitor chrissys hand
weighed heavily mind realised last ten years seen almost every day
respect tuffy grew knowledge felt sad years passed never took wife
dam snowy mountains remains broken symbol hopeless past power exists old earth
big city need longer
river runs natural course farms heartland although folks still look back old times dam
farms bigger less isolated new roads cars
river central feature heartland attracts many tourists cruise old canal restored
many people stay farms summer camp foothills snowy mountains
place used erebos become holiday resort
large lake formed grounds old house bubbling surface centre famous hot spring elysium
settlers built small town hotels camping sites lake shore
people go take waters
people invented legends telling old man lived submerged house beneath lake mystical caverns
course no one really believes tales already legends
snowy mountains remain unchanged
wild rocky peaks still home eagles
wolves sometimes heard cry moonlit nights
shepherds still graze flocks higher pastures brief summer months fewer shepherds
hardy walkers climbers spend time mountains summer essence place remains
no earthquakes rumbling rattling great stone hills
great quake became known seems stabilised region
island suidhe life continues always done
new people come live
sea crossing protection place
many visitors come summer months rarely find heart island
come look quaint little towns lie beaches
come escape stay
still fishermen sail boats harbour day
one ferry still plies waters fro city folk find hard live without cars television daily papers
none things
lack man made ephemeral things make island special place live although islanders realise
stand window night watch across waves lights big city sparkling waters hovering like tiny insects night sky
look somehow see beyond dim distance time
feel icy cool breeze blow sea snowy mountains
know somewhere deep lake elysium lies remains wolfe never found earthquake
molten rock falling stone sealed passages leading old mines
sometimes think past taken quality dream seems cross boundaries invention reality
know future lead either although may find past no longer permitted witness future chrissy
years pass son grows
barely child quite man
think room
walk window
stand watch skies singular distant light barely perceptible traces arc heavens
comet perhaps tell
although see know already passed long time ago since light crossing vast empty distance
see isnt traveller space time
watch moment longer understand little
leave open window sit desk pick pen write sit room look dark window see across mainland big city
lights city shine twinkle horizon like distant fairground floating sea black
later put pen turn light
late writing half night
go window look first light approaching dawn
late sleep tonight put coat take old broad brimmed hat peg
walk cliffs harbour
cleve stand watch endless motion sea
wave different yet somehow
see small shadow figure moving harbour wall feel cold shiver pass
go home find
upstairs old room window open bed empty
white crystal travelling lords double cross soon gathering
sit unable move moment minds eye seem see far away beneath snowy mountains wizened face strange white haired old man looking night castle tower waiting
gather together walk back home
climb stairs open door old room find son still peacefully sleeping
epilogue white light reflected high skies invading earthly space
comet landed endures eyes captured one race
remember time looked stone still fire heart ice
truth together lives ever light night eyes

no wonder never said anything war
hell explained something like bunch spoiled children like
entered state georgia got dark full moon rising horizon
manny left main highway opting back roads sometime around midnight
full moon zenith night sky bathing highway surrounding landscape soft white light
drove came long skinny lake surrounded trees small hills
lakes surface gleamed silver moonlight
turned onto small paved road heading away water heading deeper surrounding forest
road meandered valley flanked large trees thick brush
rounded corner pulled small overlook right side road
ground dropped away road
manny tired driving stopped car
heavy growth along sides road looked almost impenetrable
wasnt sure looking got car walked thick vegetation
parted first layer tangle bushes large trees spread branches road
enough moons light filtering trees manny see little stepped road forest
manny crashed thick undergrowth feet ready turn around came break foliage
wasnt much appeared game trail
manny still walk bent take advantage trail continued
trail moved left gradually descending hill
hundred feet ahead trail reached bottom slope started gradually next hill
vegetation next hill little less dense many large trees shielded ground direct sunlight
part way slope manny came rock cap outcrop granite forming large bald spot ever encompassing vegetation
manny detoured little left going smooth rock
climbing harder angle slightly steeper difficult getting solid footing
smooth cap coated thin film tiny grains sand
manny climbed outcrop dove back earth vegetation took
larger trees undergrowth less dense manny see large rocks protruding crest hill
manny found small nitch near crest hill spot two feet square large spreading tree
large rocks standing high behind formed top hill
see slope front sides rear protected rocks
manny made comfortable rocks cold damp night air surrounding
coming

private palmer extremely intelligent proficient savvy figuring make boot camp training easy possible jeopardizing anyone elses position
private palmer push limits involve circumstances
gets along well others really caring attitude others toward whether pro con get involved group dynamics
classify private palmer mildly introverted extrovert seeks diversion
manny finished put paper baylor picked another one
second proficiency report done week six done rifle range training

manny turned baylor
sergeant tell fascinates much billy palmer cohorts
well sir guys no radios no way summon support

correct probably spent war rear didnt
bills partner told snatch villagers get rear
say
sometimes officers try incorporate field company operations walk point dig bunkers stand guard things like guys didnt like grab villager escort rear
wouldnt blamed least
nothing worse specialist trained covert operations subjected everyday mayhem normal units operate
many line companies want special ops personnel expertise special ops people dont relish consider risky business ground troops
entity considers crazy foolish day
yeah billys partner mark tainer told billy good knowing
every line officer regiment knew wanted billy around
tainer told billy wounded three times every time large unit theyd walk shit
