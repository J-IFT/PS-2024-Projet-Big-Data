word monster first seizes minda seed plugged fertile agony germinate later
gabe releases puppy forget everything
lands bed immediately shrinks away
rake arms puppy gives single fearful yelp orbs hands latch energy field
feel explosion cooling ecstasy
no knowledge instinct
body greedily soaks animals energy

two brothers watch silence
eventuallyand probably isnt long reallyi lying side panting
sheets twisted smeared blood oozing wounds wrists

chapter nearness energy breaks sleep sets heart beating hard
face peers mine blissful moment dont recognize
wonder strange glow around features swell haunting music head hands seem splitting open without conscious effort
remember

cooks theory revolved around energy transference gabe continues
believed human body contained vast untapped potential strength intelligence power
tuck hands body pick torn skin around wrists
thrill sparks pain nails press gashes
little bits dried blood fall apron shirt
tarren understands science lot better thing humans cant get energy directly
think way plants suck right sun
get energy eating plants animals eat plants
really inefficient
link farther away direct energy source means theres huge loss energy
cook way cut middle steps humans absorb energy directly sun
thought pure energy allow humans reach full physical potential
itd like steroids times hundred except muscles
senses
memory
mind
butwhy
voice cracks
save gabe shrugs
cook envisioned world everyone fed directly energy sun
think itno hunger
no fighting resources
superhuman part guess see
everyone strong smart wasnt disease stuff maybe fix problems
lonely little smile plays across lips
maybe cook believed fix human nature making something better humans
no one actually nave

parents smart also nave many ways

grand many connections

tarrens face doesnt betray single twitch aura jolts red
drops trash bin
look back gabe

snatch fish water suck life away
one left
dip hand bowl
chapter brothers argue whispers bathroom using finger rub toothpaste onto teeth
leave faucet running lean door listen
subject heated discussion need night watch
intended object watch course
tarren opines kept strict guard
emotional unpredictable dangerous
gabe disagrees noting seem taking whole thing stride
votes favor full nights sleep account neither slept past two days
gabe called irresponsible
tarren called prick
neither seems offended moniker
compromise reached
exit bathroom wrists cuffed behind back apologies gabe nod tarren
despite gabes protests tarren takes floor extra pillow blanket gabe slip bed
brothers put guns pillow
tarren stays fully dressed
gabe kicks shoes throws jeans floor
lights go
wait
gabe falls asleep quickly
watch movement energy slow even
light around body dims soft round glow breath comes rhythmic whooshes pillow
cast gaze floor watch tarrens energy spike moving jerky circles webbed scarlet
energy field begins smooth jumps high
time heart beat rises quick gallop
nightmares
seems remorseless daylight
wait
mind numb empty
darkness seems vibrate lay bed mentally explore new body
entirely different thing resided within
darkness like semi sheer curtain shades room hide contents
see gabes laptop sitting table ridges lamps twist dial
smell lingering whiffs salad dressing burger
even boys unique scent
new latent energy coils inside muscles
wonder
walls catch faint throbs energy motel patrons
tell awake
sex watching
closest rooms even hear late night comedians gearing monologs
sheer volume new information difficult parse process
struggle filter coherent message
hunger peaking
couldnt possibly sleep even wanted
auras glowing blatantly bright
hands growing hot must make mental effort keep skin palms rolling back
tarren falls light sleep
energy never entirely evens jumps smaller wake
take time handcuffs giving long concentrated pulls
wrists ache
feel blood soaking bandages
pull harder
plastic strains
muscles strain
blood flows
teeth grind
wont give cant give
keep thinking maybe ryan isnt dead
maybe everything theyve told lie
brothers
grand raping mother
theyre really bad guys
happens movies time havent last two days one crazy horror movie inept actors trying hard
cuffs snap
tarren flinches mumbles something incoherent
keep still forcing breathing remain low even
drops back sleep
amazing cant hear wild beating heart
fills entire room
draw back covers step bed
wearing matching peach tank top cotton capri pants yellow hearts around hems
step tarren dainty feet
doesnt stir
pull lock back slowly window catch behind hand
muscles clenching hard bones
probably bad idea
cant really go back know
ryan isnt waiting
doctors cant stitch new tears hands
tarren might working cure tarren also wants kill
brother spend days running around murdering people
go night run
dont care happens
tug glass panel slides open squeal protest
tarren raises head blinks
eyes meet
second takes tired mind realize whats happening leap window
land
run
chapter humid night air moves grudgingly lungs tear empty back roads town cut wooded field
hear faint hiss highway distance
feels like flying
strides long graceful feel really feel new body motion
giddy fear
kind mix dreaming reality
song playing always playing seems encouraging
feel strong
pause pulling air lungs try regain bearings
night dark eyes cut right
ive run least couple miles highway close
dont move
tarren comes behind gun leveled
gasping breath trying hide
long sleeved shirt soaked sweat clinging body
spent see wavering energy field hugs close body
pained scarlet prominent
youre coming back
says words melt away glow energy

second achingly long time
bullet hisses left ear knee catches shoulder
hit ground together
gun skitters away
tarren lands back top

put hands chest slam back hard ground
shudders pain lays stunned red crackling around
know tarren rasps

strange glint relief face
closes eyes waits shame comes like sudden rain soaking right
feel sodden
cold
ryan hiding trees shakes head see must look moment precipice traipsing
fight hunger like trying push away tidal wave
tarren opens eyes
says
almost sounds like plea
control tell gritted teeth
finish noble speech inner strength power belief cant think anything
damn hungry isnt horror flick
stand take wobbly step away
tarren struggles elbow panting pain
turn away toward highway

okay whisper
takes tarren fifteen minutes find gun thick brush around
walk back silence keeping slow pace gabe nurse twisted ankle
runs fingers hair trying tame wild strands
tarren sulky silent
make back motel find stray cat wandering empty streets
boys wait
hisses approach
afterwards curl sidewalk rocking back forth shuddering need keep feeding
song rears loud drowns everything certainty must hold back
entire body tight sore aflame hunger
utterly alone
stand dizzy weak drop cats body alleyway dumpster

gabe says
one one slip back open window room
take turns washing feet tub

hes sitting bed laptop open front
yeah next time pick color

evolution
perhaps depends ask
life gone

last words human maya problems dealing alright believe difficult world no matter come
maya enjoyed peanut butter jelly sandwiches much
track team high school even though wasnt fast tendency develop shin splints halfway season
used hate sarah hendrickson became best friends
sarah got pregnant stopped hanging
maya mother treated alright bouts asthma panic attacks suspected gout strange taste mouth almost certainly indicative malignant brain tumor
maya even dad say hey kid passed roads separate lives
always bought awesome christmas presents
words introduce monster maya prefers raw alley cats peanut butter jelly sandwiches
shes track team anymore shame considering run fast
real fast
doesnt friends two brand new brothers
goal oriented individuals talented select weaponry
gabe tries hard funny
hes overcompensating something possibly hobby includes regularly killing people hang worlds morose person every day
brings tarren
monster maya might get help science experiments doesnt kill first
doesnt kill
really air point
one last thing monster maya
doesnt mother anymore father
somewhat strained relationship
typical father daughter trope
wants family business
plans
hes looking water bridge
find way destroy
brutally
possibly involving guns daggers throwing stars bare hands
monster maya doesnt get shin splints anymore
sic sic sic
one lock hair dangling behind left ear
sic
sit toilet eyes watering hair absorbs potent chemicals
convinced ryan desperately love
engaged practically though topic never came
recall single argument
one bad habit got nerves
time together ringed soft white lighting around edges
voice always soft full endearments
relationship filled laughter adventure great sex never got awkward tiny bit boring sometimes
leads second train thought kill grand
aforementioned daggers throwing stars bare hands considered must really plan winning condemnation lay upon dying ears
something grave deep utterly cutting elevate victory heroic bard singing levels
throw open bathroom door ask gabe pen paper
holding nose obliges come ryan
short simple poignant yet clich
wanted daughter
well got one
upon reflection one doesnt make whole lot sense
took everything man loved even humanity
fair return favor
imagine delivering half choked whisper twist dagger already plunged chest
eventually settle something different
word memorized instantly though plan repeating every night fall asleep
ready moment comes
become mantra invocation hate vengeance filled new hollowed body
feels good purpose

tarren makes noise back throat
keep gaze window noting mom pop antique shop pressed kfc boxy colored walgreens

bushy fir trees hug close road catch swatches larger houses set far back wooded lots
sometimes thin mailboxes peeking foliage flag life

without warning hurls empty bottle shatters tree spectacle exploding glass

apologize instead use safe little notebook
small apologies first
tonight apologize lamsin shakespeare professor missing class
awkwardness disappearance may caused classmates
sincerely hope ongoing search body cause continual distraction
pen falters
last lines letter wait closure
spent time roof yesterday reading hamlet close eyes words suspended ether mind
quickly peruse iambic pentameters pluck random flower scribble though suspect hardly makes sense
words fly thoughts remain words without thoughts never heaven go
feel slightly better maybe even little noble suffering endured
submitting like katherina
cracking wide open like ophelia
giving like juliette
yet
close notebook trace intricate swirls front
quality journal black electric blue lines twisting around front back cover
real spine thick vanilla paper
surprised pull bag clothes toiletries tarren picked
didnt ask buy
next morning ready
crouch roof letting rising sun wake skin
door opens tarren takes deep breath fresh air
polite cough gain attention exaggerate leap effect throwing backwards roof
graceful twist land softly front tarren
impressed mad skills fails show
pretend wasnt expecting compliment
try match detached air pushing back shoulders setting face disaffected expression hint grimace
want run say
tarren frowns
frown back
frown
meant apologize
meant say hello
tarren takes without word follow keeping shoulder
move woods skipping roots shuttling embankments
tarren increases speed stay
run silence hour sun warms air around
sure turned back already tarren keeps pushing forward
realize hes testing
wanted see breaking tense reserve hes turned gesture reconciliation competition
keep face placid anger flares
amazing easily tarren reach inside stir dark places memories like butterflies take wing flutter front eyes
gun held steady aimed head
tarrens gun
blood
cold eyes locking onto mine mirror
humorless mouth
glowering face
stupid nice things almost make feel sorry
dont
tarren wants competition hell get
one glance energy field know beat
sweat runs face heart thudding hard
heavy sun propels even weakens
miles slips beneath shoes tarren stubbornly keeps pace
stay shoulder
trees trap heat turn swampy around
body wet things inside lungs hamstrings calves ache deepening timbres
going win wont long
weve running hard hours
tarrens steps swaying
energy faded thin foggy glow hugs close body spikes red wild yellow jags
want fail sing head
fail fail fail
fail trail
fall nail
darkness stirred tasting sweet
giddy idea watching crumple heat exhaustion
needs humbled
except hes already humbled
broken trying crush pieces smaller
fast comes anger empties mind
surprise slow
tarren call cantcant run anymore
sure
tries wheeze
cheeks flushed deep red hair goes black soaked like

exactly good tarren real tarren someone looks like may smile real
chapter two weeks pass something like routine begins develop gabe finds angel go
tarren run morning silent focused racing sun lumbers horizon
follow rhythmic rise fall tarrens shoulder scarce moments mind empties song hollow distant
come home bluegrass strumming gabes computer speakers studies death finds small flowers humor seemingly barren field
gives obit day pretend creepy isnt something sinister staked gauzy invisible like spider webs around lives
afternoon boys go town fight return home new bruises little jags red auras
spend long hot noon hours shooting empty soup cans backyard grunting weights basement
evening gabe replaces bluegrass twang punky alternative beats fiddles web code plays online poker chats friends never know real name
tarren finds chores lees house riddles questions lab
tarrens lab
expect needles jumbo computers brain wave readers beakers foaming purple liquid
instead find small tidy room filled books locked filing cabinet small fridge single microscope desk
notice faint outline shapes walls beneath layers white paint remember gabe telling tammys bedroom
no crazy experiments no dashes lightning high cackling laughs
no trace vial holding magic glowing cure
instead tarren never ending list mundane questions breaking bits pieces
lie
recorder sits desk next drinking hedges nervous stutters long silences dont know answer evade
dont tell tarren colors auras
song
tarren asks grand changed emphasize one needle part spin around stool always makes frown
almost relief tarren asks pushups pull ups jump run loop woods fast lift ever increasing amounts weight
never press full limit
deeply embedded fear doesnt want reveal true strength tarren perhaps
terrifies muscles unleash tide pushups bench press two hundred pounds two fifty three hundred stop wrong
cant decipher dark muddy colors climb tarrens aura watches records numbers
learn key extricating tarrens questions tests start asking questions
mothers voice sound like
diana tell children angels
start training
begin kill
people fight angels
fox brothers aunts uncles grandparents
soon enough tarren put storm clouds face duck behind
done says free go hang gabe read book roof imagine new grand killing scenarios write apologies people old life
night gabe mood rock cranks loud pulls different map views computer screen searches patterns among dead
doesnt find anything watch cheesy action flicks hell goad playing video games
always fries fireballs skewers samurai sword pummels pulp getting good quick
ask questions put storm clouds tarrens face gabe takes delight answering one blatant long winded lie closely resembles plot star wars indiana jones one national lampoon vacation movies
particular night one moods cant really handle anything crawl onto roof think diana
close eyes see face perfectly way beach photograph bookshelf bedroom
beautiful strong modern day amazon think terrible mother raise children soldiers
press guns hands deny chance know anything different
kind love
obsessed revenge sacrifice anything
question echoes mind turns fangs
far go kill grand
know better answer
try rein darkness awake churning
dianamom gave away protecting glad rid
stare stars imaging blue gray eyes hidden somewhere beneath bright points
even carry term
gabe rescues thoughts
clamors loudly onto roof stretches back next lets big sigh
sitting legs crossed automatically tuck hands protectively sleeves big jacket
look stars dont say anything
perhaps catch secrets hearts hold brave enough give voice
pixie girl stupid girl
night filled cricket harmonies slow dip fireflies
take breath smelling scent pine needles hearing animal songs lifting trees around
still seems strange hear undercurrent traffic many different voices strangers going lives close approximation breathe catch hints barbeque fast food car exhaust
loneliness thisremembering alone lost
colorado loses heat night gabe always seems comfortable shirt
good measure kicks shoes
one picks speed goes tumbling slope roof
leaping like dancer hooking finger laces catching shoe plunges night
bring renegade footwear back gabe
show drawls
smile doesnt linger face notice new darker shades pulsing aura
no discernable reason gabe begins answering questions given asking
tells diana started training children young self defense
taught run away angels ever came hide
always know exits
look everyones hands dont let know youre looking
stay calm
always stay calm
gabe doesnt realize well see face darkness speaks careful indifference slides away thats left lost puppy look lots lines smiles fled far away

moisture hangs air fresh piney scent trees animal odors fresh release wet forest floor
breathe close eyes jump letting instinct take body
dont catch scent dont find footprints air know angel
discovered natural pathway trees leaped along branches thrilled freedom rush motion
later eyes spot unnatural shade blue among leaves find snag clothing sharp point bark

no
dont trust

second presses cold wet deeper center bones limbs ache
press teeth together keep chattering
initial fear jitters exhaust dulling waxy wariness
try keep eyes gabes form keep slipping away thoughts wander discomfort new secrets ive added pile
restrained memories twist chains screaming terrible things beneath gags
beyond hum wretched thoughts ears pick sound grunt surprise somewhere far right
rain stopped sound carries across wide space forest
body tenses ears honing
comes low strangled call
recognize guttural cry
ryan made seizing sound grand tore life body
maya no
dont understand tarrens shout realize feet planting muddy ground launch trees
chapter leaves slap like wet hands charging roots twisting around trees without thinking
need get sound need save ryan
isnt ryan
find crumpled body man half mile away stakeout
wrong many ways torqued upper body wide unfocused eyes mouth still caught last garbled choke colorless
no aura around no dance emotion no churning cloud life
brain starts inconspicuously edging room panic feels like
kneel next man
terrified touch hand lingers shoulder
eyes werent open
dead word punches head
dead dead dead
listen heartbeat watch chest breath find nothing
things get lot worse
hear sound footsteps approaching
assume tarren ready pull scruff neck drag back car
stupid think finally finally realize angel still
stare shadowed figure emerging woods wondering angel look like long dripping claws finds
boy steps trees angel tarren
reason alone fall wildly love
eyes latch reddish hued energy circling around body amazingly utterlyhuman
love entrenched dark eyes tall skinny body tuffs brown hair standing head even weird goatee thing chin

boy asks
flashlight sweeps across ground
see light coming stand dumb rock
hits body stops
pastor reynolds

tug behind keep running
slight hesitation picks pace let go arm
behind boy screams come back
almost feel tarrens mega scowl searing back
whistle hollers another

tarren run together try pretend another run woods
another glorious morning sun soon peek flat face horizon

fighting every second reserve ive got left
tarren please cry loud
twist head away hands scramble backwards solid tree back
tarren flinches drops hands
course says face changing
creases come mouth sets
whatever thing sworn concern hadnt perched upon particular face gone
thoughts coming back stitched crooked good enough

scream
chapter keep screaming
might ryans name something coherent like
dont think
words strange tearing also emptiness mind trying escape body lest comprehend happened
boyfriend kisses shoulders took quiet pathways avalon suddenly still eyes glass half lidded dark stain growing across crotch
stranger looking
tall tell powerful person
person kicked around wins fights even start
voice quiet calm word crisp like water drops hitting cheeks
leaving
opens arms dont understand
crouched ryan gripping shirt
also watching strangers glowing hands wondering hurts
something coming
feel vibrations hook around tug upright
see feel invisible string pulls toward stranger
start slide across cobblestones

clutch ryans shirt body drags
no no no
invisible force pries fingers loose one one
no no no moan
ryan drops back spin strangers arms
dont understand happened know strangers invisible string
hook
stranger embraces
feel breath cut across ear stomach wrenches
vomit across shirt
low gurgled moan comes throat
unbecoming behavior daughter mine
wraps arms around waist
lift sky
running steps

boy baseball cap curly hair
pauses ryans body looks around

time swings gun around shot stranger already rocketing away night
stars streaks boy shrinking dot beneath lamp light
hear voice echoing distance

air cool strangers arms strong
mind flees dark recess
close eyes feel tears flicking chin dark
senses short circuit everything bleary except random bits stand like vivid darts pain dark row storage units coming nearer descend minor jolt landing sound strangers shoes crunching beneath gravel sweep headlights strafing rows closed metal doors
mind clutches light hoping police car no sirens headlights jump away
short later lying concrete floor inside one storage units
pull legs chest
lumpy purse hip strap still twisted around arm
metal door shuts bang like gunshot like panic like gruesome finality
man lurks somewhere dark question hiccups mind man something else entirely
light flickers tuck head chest protect eyes
voice comes
inelegant accommodations know couldnt rely composure
wail crawls throat
kill

breath gone
huff voice cracks heart cracks mind cracks
stare strangers shoes tears
expensive looking loafers kind tassels top mocked vast distant past didnt know monsters wore tasseled loafers
shoes walk away
try escape scream help otherwise try save
wrap arms around body weep
brave
curled floor sobbing retching caring stranger glows death hands
glow death
rather crouches near eyes probe face
shame says always born human
extends hand realize weve come end
gallant enough wipe nose dont die snot bubbling nostrils
palm opens reveal two capsules

prepared outburst disappointing
voice still soft still calm no inflection emotion
changed navy polo shirt white buttons collar

swift motion grabs neck claps hand mouth
try scream suck pills instead
picks places small cot center space

first time look around
naked light bulb sways duffle bag folded towel sit next cot

monster
curved horns puppy devouring sitting roof thinking jumping scared tired come option better concrete blood art
take breath
voice coming back

gabe looks away quickly
hands fiddle nothing
thats call
big egos
way big
licks chapped lips
see angels arent exactly precious moments figurines society likes think
bible angels gods warriors
smite enemies
lots times disguise humans theyre something else
terrible strong
super humans
thats angels theyre working god
come
outer space
sure joke gabe laughs
nah science
evil genius frankenstein science stops looks
know kind policy never talk
tell
itll sound crazy
pushing palms flat concrete roof
hard
keeping really want latch onto gabes energy field aura whatever drain
ill keep open mind clever thing say
manage tell
gabe keeps staring
cant imagine must look like right evidently evokes enough pity says gary cook
created angels
scientist
like mad scientist
no
opposite actually
eyes come meet mine no humor
know say road hell paved good intentions
says softly
gary cook poster child good intentions gone bad
thing looked world saw heaps suffering everyone going
hunger sickness petty violence decided something
mixing monsters lab
came idea
pretty damned brazen actually
gabe takes swill breath lets long slow like needs time figure next words
cook decided make angels
cant actually seriousexcept
thats got inspiration
wanted turn men angels
stare
gabe shrugs
dude little whacked head believed possible gabe searches word reengineer human body
theorized humans made stronger faster keener sensesthat anything possible
maybe even human flight
say
man
last night

gabe turns head look
youre taking little well
no
dont know
ive begun barricade emotions behind mental door ruthless efficiency
still considering letting slip roof first want know happened
need understand might go killing man
sorry ryan
revenge surely beneath
revenge weak souls justice beginning learn weak
cooks theory revolved around energy transference gabe continues
believed human body contained vast untapped potential strength intelligence power
tuck hands body pick torn skin around wrists
thrill sparks pain nails press gashes
little bits dried blood fall apron shirt
tarren understands science lot better thing humans cant get energy directly
think way plants suck right sun
get energy eating plants animals eat plants
really inefficient
link farther away direct energy source means theres huge loss energy
cook way cut middle steps humans absorb energy directly sun
thought pure energy allow humans reach full physical potential
itd like steroids times hundred except muscles
senses
memory
mind
butwhy
voice cracks
save gabe shrugs
cook envisioned world everyone fed directly energy sun
think itno hunger
no fighting resources
superhuman part guess see
everyone strong smart wasnt disease stuff maybe fix problems
lonely little smile plays across lips
maybe cook believed fix human nature making something better humans
no one actually nave
dont know gabe sits braces hands behind
havent ever wanted create better world
absolutely no idea respond
mean dont think suddenly imploding manic tortured laughter pleasant either
luckily get distracted body going crazy
chapter gabe say get attention
additional weirdness definitely happening
skin tingles hands peel back grow hot
turn watch veiny pink orbs lift surface palms
distance sun cleared horizon
sunlight crawls knees flows across hands
whats happening
ask
song quiets feel deep fog exhaustion begin lift mind
senses sharpen
gaze tinted windows squat building three streets
woman runs vacuum roughly carpet make gaudy rings fingers large silver hoop earrings swaying earlobe
hear old mans wavering voice order egg mcmuffin mcdonalds drive thru
song grown softer turn gabe see glow energy feel confident give snatch away life
youre taking energy sun like cook theorized

holds hand light
stilli mean still inside

tarren opines kept strict guard
emotional unpredictable dangerous
gabe disagrees noting seem taking whole thing stride
votes favor full nights sleep account neither slept past two days
gabe called irresponsible

gabe falls asleep quickly
watch movement energy slow even
light around body dims soft round glow breath comes rhythmic whooshes pillow
cast gaze floor watch tarrens energy spike moving jerky circles webbed scarlet
energy field begins smooth jumps high
time heart beat rises quick gallop
nightmares
seems remorseless daylight
wait
mind numb empty
darkness seems vibrate lay bed mentally explore new body
entirely different thing resided within
darkness like semi sheer curtain shades room hide contents
see gabes laptop sitting table ridges lamps twist dial
smell lingering whiffs salad dressing burger
even boys unique scent
new latent energy coils inside muscles
wonder
walls catch faint throbs energy motel patrons
tell awake
sex watching
closest rooms even hear late night comedians gearing monologs
sheer volume new information difficult parse process
struggle filter coherent message
hunger peaking
couldnt possibly sleep even wanted
auras glowing blatantly bright
hands growing hot must make mental effort keep skin palms rolling back
tarren falls light sleep
energy never entirely evens jumps smaller wake
take time handcuffs giving long concentrated pulls
wrists ache
feel blood soaking bandages
pull harder
plastic strains
muscles strain
blood flows
teeth grind
wont give cant give
keep thinking maybe ryan isnt dead
maybe everything theyve told lie
brothers
grand raping mother
theyre really bad guys
happens movies time havent last two days one crazy horror movie inept actors trying hard
cuffs snap
tarren flinches mumbles something incoherent
keep still forcing breathing remain low even
drops back sleep
amazing cant hear wild beating heart
fills entire room
draw back covers step bed
wearing matching peach tank top cotton capri pants yellow hearts around hems
step tarren dainty feet
doesnt stir
pull lock back slowly window catch behind hand
muscles clenching hard bones
probably bad idea
cant really go back know
ryan isnt waiting
doctors cant stitch new tears hands
tarren might working cure tarren also wants kill

dont care happens
tug glass panel slides open squeal protest
tarren raises head blinks
eyes meet
second takes tired mind realize whats happening leap window

chapter humid night air moves grudgingly lungs tear empty back roads town cut wooded field
hear faint hiss highway distance

pause pulling air lungs try regain bearings
night dark eyes cut right
ive run least couple miles highway close

time together ringed soft white lighting around edges
voice always soft full endearments
relationship filled laughter adventure great sex never got awkward tiny bit boring sometimes
leads second train thought kill grand
aforementioned daggers throwing stars bare hands considered must really plan winning condemnation lay upon dying ears
something grave deep utterly cutting elevate victory heroic bard singing levels
throw open bathroom door ask gabe pen paper
holding nose obliges come ryan
short simple poignant yet clich
wanted daughter
well got one
upon reflection one doesnt make whole lot sense
took everything man loved even humanity
fair return favor
imagine delivering half choked whisper twist dagger already plunged chest
eventually settle something different
word memorized instantly though plan repeating every night fall asleep
ready moment comes
become mantra invocation hate vengeance filled new hollowed body
feels good purpose
words say grand gurgles last blood soaked breath feet everything ever stood forgotten
bury body deep ground no one ever dig
ill rid world every single one angels death
soak dreams blood burn ash

tarren makes noise back throat
keep gaze window noting mom pop antique shop pressed kfc boxy colored walgreens
stores dry road becomes playful sneaking cracks potholes wheels
bushy fir trees hug close road catch swatches larger houses set far back wooded lots
sometimes thin mailboxes peeking foliage flag life
farewell civilization gabe says laugh

theres xbox precarious tower dvds next
say softly
craigslist stuffy british butler far no luck gabe says

air room stale heavy tinted old perfume lazy dust particles
dust
fine layer lies across floor clings mirror vanity gathers folds white curtains
open mouth utter sort shaky compliment attention snatched away
bookshelves
boys still standing doorway forgotten

small apologies first
tonight apologize lamsin shakespeare professor missing class
awkwardness disappearance may caused classmates
sincerely hope ongoing search body cause continual distraction
pen falters
last lines letter wait closure
spent time roof yesterday reading hamlet close eyes words suspended ether mind
quickly peruse iambic pentameters pluck random flower scribble though suspect hardly makes sense
words fly thoughts remain words without thoughts never heaven go
feel slightly better maybe even little noble suffering endured
submitting like katherina
cracking wide open like ophelia
giving like juliette
yet
close notebook trace intricate swirls front
quality journal black electric blue lines twisting around front back cover
real spine thick vanilla paper
surprised pull bag clothes toiletries tarren picked
didnt ask buy
next morning ready
crouch roof letting rising sun wake skin
door opens tarren takes deep breath fresh air
polite cough gain attention exaggerate leap effect throwing backwards roof
graceful twist land softly front tarren
impressed mad skills fails show
pretend wasnt expecting compliment
try match detached air pushing back shoulders setting face disaffected expression hint grimace
want run say
tarren frowns
frown back
frown
meant apologize
meant say hello
tarren takes without word follow keeping shoulder
move woods skipping roots shuttling embankments
tarren increases speed stay
run silence hour sun warms air around
sure turned back already tarren keeps pushing forward
realize hes testing
wanted see breaking tense reserve hes turned gesture reconciliation competition
keep face placid anger flares
amazing easily tarren reach inside stir dark places memories like butterflies take wing flutter front eyes
gun held steady aimed head
tarrens gun
blood
cold eyes locking onto mine mirror
humorless mouth
glowering face
stupid nice things almost make feel sorry
dont
tarren wants competition hell get
one glance energy field know beat
sweat runs face heart thudding hard
heavy sun propels even weakens
miles slips beneath shoes tarren stubbornly keeps pace
stay shoulder
trees trap heat turn swampy around
body wet things inside lungs hamstrings calves ache deepening timbres
going win wont long
weve running hard hours
tarrens steps swaying
energy faded thin foggy glow hugs close body spikes red wild yellow jags
want fail sing head
fail fail fail
fail trail
fall nail
darkness stirred tasting sweet
giddy idea watching crumple heat exhaustion
needs humbled
except hes already humbled
broken trying crush pieces smaller
fast comes anger empties mind
surprise slow
tarren call cantcant run anymore
sure
tries wheeze
cheeks flushed deep red hair goes black soaked like
still insists long sleeves pants even though know
yeah drop
keep going though
fine says
dont know way back

notice faint outline shapes walls beneath layers white paint remember gabe telling tammys bedroom
no crazy experiments no dashes lightning high cackling laughs
no trace vial holding magic glowing cure
instead tarren never ending list mundane questions breaking bits pieces

clamors loudly onto roof stretches back next lets big sigh
sitting legs crossed automatically tuck hands protectively sleeves big jacket
look stars dont say anything
perhaps catch secrets hearts hold brave enough give voice
pixie girl stupid girl

hear voices across park raising call
stupid hope
gabe pulls main trail following small veins beaten dirt thick hedges spruce pine
birds take wing overhead cant help turn head toward new noise
hands pulsing heat ball fists

halt wide expanse river
moisture hangs air fresh piney scent trees animal odors fresh release wet forest floor
breathe close eyes jump letting instinct take body
dont catch scent dont find footprints air know angel
discovered natural pathway trees leaped along branches thrilled freedom rush motion
later eyes spot unnatural shade blue among leaves find snag clothing sharp point bark
seventy feet ground standing thick branch none dexterous pick axe wielding humans climb
loosen fabric rub soft fleece fingers

close eyes inhale fabrics scent
angel
deep woods near paths anywhere even rugged woodsman wander
angel come far away quarry
sit branch take world around

brothers look energies syncing
gabe sighs
wander past fields past community garden past dog park woods
stay away flashlights others tromping around calling sunshine baileys ghost
angel everywhere small noise gust wind rattling branches new smell clamors attention
little ways woods gabe curls bench positioning stained duffle bag head
checks pistol still holding semi automatic tucks hands sleeves khaki coat
watch amazement energy lowers flattens around body almost sleeping
tarren hunker trees yards away
tarren lies stomach eye fixed scope sniper rifle
drape across wide branch watch energy slow dampen also

angels connect energy output humans tarren whispers
sense emotions like fear nervousness
hunt lock things

mental tricks
breathing
quiet
nervous quiet
dont like gabe open alone
keep imaging black shadow swooping snatching away
rain falls around tagging leaves dripping thin cotton pants
water skews world disrupting normal smells blanketing sounds forest
senses kilter feel naked without
cold
dont track volunteers whisper tarren
split cover ground wait angel found piece fabric
might come back
no
dont trust
dont think control accuse
cant take angel

end discussion maya
rest chin gloved hands fume
hunger hasnt let erodes away composure
think massive nail file wearing away frontal cortex cant get image head next hour
feel helpless melding branch thinking nail files waiting something come try kill brother
know exactly tarrens rifle sounds like cleanly pierces aluminum soup cans brothers rigged throughout wooded backyard
wonder angel tumble backwards flipping end end
wonder much blood expect terrible screeches death stammering final monologs like movies
minutes hours stubborn digging heels
second presses cold wet deeper center bones limbs ache
press teeth together keep chattering
initial fear jitters exhaust dulling waxy wariness
try keep eyes gabes form keep slipping away thoughts wander discomfort new secrets ive added pile
restrained memories twist chains screaming terrible things beneath gags
beyond hum wretched thoughts ears pick sound grunt surprise somewhere far right
rain stopped sound carries across wide space forest
body tenses ears honing
comes low strangled call
recognize guttural cry
ryan made seizing sound grand tore life body
maya no
dont understand tarrens shout realize feet planting muddy ground launch trees
chapter leaves slap like wet hands charging roots twisting around trees without thinking
need get sound need save ryan
isnt ryan
find crumpled body man half mile away stakeout
wrong many ways torqued upper body wide unfocused eyes mouth still caught last garbled choke colorless
no aura around no dance emotion no churning cloud life
brain starts inconspicuously edging room panic feels like
kneel next man
terrified touch hand lingers shoulder
eyes werent open
dead word punches head
dead dead dead
listen heartbeat watch chest breath find nothing
things get lot worse
hear sound footsteps approaching
assume tarren ready pull scruff neck drag back car
stupid think finally finally realize angel still
stare shadowed figure emerging woods wondering angel look like long dripping claws finds
boy steps trees angel tarren
reason alone fall wildly love
eyes latch reddish hued energy circling around body amazingly utterlyhuman
love entrenched dark eyes tall skinny body tuffs brown hair standing head even weird goatee thing chin

boy asks
flashlight sweeps across ground
see light coming stand dumb rock
hits body stops
pastor reynolds
boy chokes
beam light jerks hits knee rushes body
boys aura unleashes bright canary yellows whites response every muscle clenches hard
beam light stare aura listen song
hands whispers
dont look know glowing
feel skin scrolling back feeding buds rising chambers throwing flares heat
hungry say stop
stop
holy hells bells gazelles
whatwhat
boy whispers
boy really must age
turn run
pause hear steps come crashing
kid must dumber
chases boogey man
aware stop turn around peel horrible itchy gloves hands
boy run right embrace

feel tarrens energy coming simmering angry orange hes obviously trying hold check
drop run toward
stops sees
hook arm swing around roughly
tarren trusts enough automatically shoot guess something
tug behind keep running
slight hesitation picks pace let go arm
behind boy screams come back
almost feel tarrens mega scowl searing back
whistle hollers another
soon whole chorus shrill notes rise forest
tarren run together try pretend another run woods
another glorious morning sun soon peek flat face horizon
brings enough start thinking
collect gabe packed sniper rifle weave around frantic humans bright pounding energies
make back car already hear cry police sirens pitching distance growing louder
tarren lets leash energy slip little aura ratchets bright oranges reds set body humming
stares hand hovers gun waist
look whimper heard guy scream couldnt stand still tarren growls feral dangerous sound
tarren didnt gabe starts
quiet tarren cuts brother

eyes flash back gray flint hard
theres nothing tarrens face merest crevice cling
watch fingers brush barrel gun ready flip holster shoot

gabes energy bright star
shivering hard water droplets jump hair
monster presses paper thin wall control keeps pushing pushing pushing tarrens body relaxes hand drops away gun
get car tells quiet menace rattlesnake
gabe sighs long whoosh air
thank jesus mutters red slowly dissipates aura

hands still glowing press belly pull legs tight pin place
gabe opens back door leaning holds wool blanket
even dont acknowledge offering even though sirens loud enough boys must able hear gabe doesnt move
face wrecked heroic intent
slowly lower knees unwind arms reach take blanket hand
chapter ride back expect tarren charge fast loud wailing freight train
instead voice drops dangerous quiet says jeopardized everything
gabe told diana wither children stare softest words mouth often carried deadliest stings
tarren must much like
lay gabe says though theres long pause silence
pull itchy blanket tighter around frame try look anything

amber falling toward rolling branch
shes gone gasping breath tasting metal mouth
hear body smack branch final thump hits soft ground
stars back sky
maybe never left
head throbbing
thoughts percolating unfinished
blood
dont fall
voice calls
maya
carefully twist stomach squint past powerful flashlight beam
tarren peering gun side
pain drums skull big powerful timpani beats
small clips time keep slipping away
arms shaking weak lower branches
gone
ground somehow kneeling tree
tarrens eyes mine
raining
murmur need something talk might awkward
strange croaking voice dont recognize
neck feels pulpy bruised like rotted fruit
gone
tarren knees front saying something
scar others concealed still see
secrets hidden scars scars

doesnt think funny
wont ever smile
tarren reaches hesitates touches head lightly running fingers surface scalp hiss pain
says
gone
fingers hair feather touches still hurts
feel contusion theres no blood tarren says
thats good
suddenly afraid cant losing time
tarren close energy colors song making crazy thoughts scattered like puzzle pieces broken like glass shards splattered like raindrops scrambled like eggs spotty like dalmatian far far away like stars hidden behind clouds
fighting every second reserve ive got left
tarren please cry loud
twist head away hands scramble backwards solid tree back
tarren flinches drops hands
course says face changing
creases come mouth sets
whatever thing sworn concern hadnt perched upon particular face gone
thoughts coming back stitched crooked good enough
instinctively press palms ground groaning mud seeps fingers
amber sprawled couple feet away
arm twisted behind looks like broken doll careless child dropped forgot put away
killed say turning back tarren

take note slight shift
tarren said angel
maybe
maybe
eyes dark hooded hes careful energy
ive tipped much see

dont worry
youre going back motel
brave say no shouldnt alone
accompany tarren night
help wrap broken bloody body tarp
wrestle wet ground way shovels lower child shallow ditch
brave say something good meaningful amber pushed sloppy mud upon
maybe forgive least tell really understand hunger things made
lures dance head close reality single slip propel mind living nightmare
brave
tired wet numb
feel like little girl sit car waiting tarren emerge woods carrying tarp wrapped burden
notice slightest dip vehicle lays body trunk
tears slip face head back
tarren silent lipstick no longer back window everything else done wrong tonight
lean doorframe opening closing eyes trying figure one less painful throbbing head
try swallow stop trying
instead wonder strange expression caught tarrens face
got close without keeping hand gun
gone

describe hides every part behind thousand granite shields
wonder shy little boy curled center phalanx shields protecting nothing
angry
tired
wet wrung
still shivering
hungry
weve sitting silence long
gabe doesnt know
no
tense
tarren doesnt realize isnt punishment
never told grand found
no
maybe gabe found sooner grand almost say tricked swallow words manage came
warned hid dont know something
possible says
tarren
silence
salvage pride
cant understand expression face
cant understand anything
arent even sorry
cry
tarrens energy escapes control jumps high conflagration pained red deepest ochre blasts open palms
wrestles
yes
quiet
strained behind closed teeth
yes says one even softer
nearly inaudible old ears
open door suv
rain pecks leg shoulder step
deep moist breath
puddles broken clouded muddy feet
wont tell gabe
look defenses dented holding
thank whispers
need learn fight
ill teach
starts engine
good
close door tarren drives away leaving ghost grand trailing chilled fingers back
searching
discovering knows
baited brothers concern
tricked followed
knew find
faulty heroes wont tell
pain enough already
guilt enough
burdens enough
tilt head back catch falling raindrops mouth
taste like rust feel little human
chapter empty motel room pull clothes slowly though painful no matter
freestyle blood art face necklaced bruises puffy shoulder purple blue amoeba along back hit tree branch red rimmed eyes mouth open panting strangled notes misery dont know possibly handle

theres no sun today day
clutch sides sink retching dust stomach
thinking zac effron grinning empty bed jonas brothers jamming no one listening
shower takes blood skin stay longer see get anything else
afterwards sit floor bathroom tear muddy clothes half ill never wear decapitate smiling teddy bear
rabbit smart enough hide beneath gabes bed
lay mine keeping fingers curled tight open slits hands wait brothers try think anything
whisper grands taunt syllables creased worn use
everything ever stood forgotten
bury body deep ground no one ever dig
ill rid world every single one angels death
soak dreams blood burn ash
wont speck left world better place
goodbye father
grand still world
waiting
plotting
followed boys must lost fight
hasnt found yet hell try
tarren train ill ready

brothers return together three hours later
listen car doors open close
faint whispers energy know well
slow circles gabe twitching tarren
stand front tarrens door try imagine look must exchanging
get rest tarren says

tarren thinks answering
doesnt choice
guess
gabe walks door
pauses probably fishing key card

goodnight
get rest tarren says
open close doors together
taken time pull covers body tuck hands beneath pillow close eyes
hitch breath gabe pauses bed
moves let breath slow
gabe stays shower long time
listen hiss water sound scrubbing
lady mcbeth sits sink laughs
shower gabe keeps boxers white undershirt tosses black clothing general proximity duffle bag
sir hopsalot induced emerge hideout despite promises bowl overflowing salad mix
half hour online gabe shuts computer runs hand drying hair turns lamp
lay separate beds staring different things
gabe picks ceiling choose energy watching tick agitation like tarrens
try stay still twitching allow
hour goes energy still sparking heart thumping fast
still smell bleach clothes wearing
blood
twitching harder
hands sweating pillow
bulbs pulsing hot
thoughts coming undone

ask
sigh

gabe turns head direction


hunting angels
lets say win
tarren creates cure
whatever

krugal talk
long pause follows gabes energy shivers wan yellows
almost see memories playing across mind pressing sharp nails psyche
yeah says finally
certain pressure points body
didnt take long

job gabe whispers sure hes trying convince
silent long
gabe shifts back stares ceiling
curl hands fists bite lip push nails flesh palms
anything hook attention away hunger growing panic night never end
rain patters windows
much rain
finally desperation ask really think well win
long quiet
dont know gabe whispers

wait night together lost different struggles
eventually torment loosens grip gabes mind
watch aura lose peaks eddies yields exhaustion drifts heavy sleep
energy hums smooth quiet
no nightmares
lucky brother
soon gabe asleep bed across room
sitting desk
tapping tapping tapping fingers
following tarrens energy jittery exhausted paces next door
trying keep reign
thinking amber said evil
cant think really
faux thoughts tangled ribbons leading ugly hunger inside
song
audio hostem
describe song
pull notebook soggy apologies bag
open clean page
press fingers hard temples feel heat hands side face
glowing
knees jiggering
tarren still pacing
gabe breathing slow stupid enough fall asleep monster room

gabe shifts sleep energy jumps
evil even though suddenly standing bed
animal

wavy hair pillow
smells like soap shampoo
aura round perfect

painless death sweet brother
maybe even sort kindness
no worries no fear no aching loneliness
going kill tarren
cruel take away person left

fallen angel
swirled together muddy brown
hand reaches toward glowing bright
gabe blocking tarrens gun big heart
maya take hand
trusting life right
putting deodorant

wont let slip
wont let fall
way glances sometimes streaks loving purple spread aura
never flinches touch
gabe rescues like always
look sleeping brother need someone believe
need know someone thinks strong enough save even dont
epilogue roof motel though cant remember leaving room
hunger still tearing pieces means didnt kill gabe
tears relief drip face maybe terror strange sad mixture
laughing hiccups retches
notebook hands remember
one letter havent written
one persons forgiveness yet begged
ask forgiveness acknowledge dead
lay flowers upon grave wish well whatever comes though suspect isnt anything
open notebook flip past pages
hands shivering twitchy feel control worst passed alone roof
words dont come
wait
take deep breath wet wonderful
amber said aura small ugly though means still part human
dig nails palms finallsy digest words realize mean
hybrid say words loud
means theres hope
hope control hunger
didnt pass crucial test
wasnt song drowning still held breath
hiccups dying heart takes kicking hard chest testing integrity ribs
little snaps go stomach like butterflies exploding
control whisper awed
believe
really
look crazy terrible paragraphs scrawled pages notebook
